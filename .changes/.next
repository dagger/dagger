# This file is a custom file we use to indicate the next version of dagger -
# this version is used to determine how dev versions should be tagged.
#
# For example, if set to vX.Y.Z, then dev versions will be tagged as
# vX.Y.Z-<prerelease> using go pseudoversioning.
#
# This file can also be left empty - if it is, then the next version is
# automagically determined from release note entries (and then adding to the
# patch release).

v0.14.1
