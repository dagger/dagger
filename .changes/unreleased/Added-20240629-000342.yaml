  cli: allow calling core functions directly

  Usage: `dagger core <function>`
  Example: `dagger core container from --address=alpine terminal`

  Works the same as `dagger call`, but instead of loading a user module, it only uses functions in the core API.
  
  Run `dagger core --help` for available functions.
