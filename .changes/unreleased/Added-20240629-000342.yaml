  cli: allow calling core functions directly

  Usage: `dagger core <function>`
  Example: `dagger core container from --address=alpine terminal`

  Works the same as `dagger call`, but instead of loading a user module, 
  it only uses functions from the core API.
  
  Run `dagger core --help` for available functions.

  _Note that this command is experimental and the DX for calling core functions 
  in the CLI may change in the future._
