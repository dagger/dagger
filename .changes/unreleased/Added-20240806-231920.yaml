  Add `Digest` method to `File`.

  This method provides an efficient way to compute a file's digest, which unlock optimized file comparison
  or check for file changes.
  This function benefits from Buildkit's cache system and include file's metadata in the digest computation.
  There's also an option `excludeMetadata` to compute the file's digest from its content only.
