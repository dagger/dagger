    Support private modules with new SSH ref scheme and forward of SSH agent:
    - Go-like refs (currently used) remain active
    - http / https schemes are now supported as alternative public module refs
    - SSH refs are introduced, with support of SCP-like refs git@provider:user/repo and explicit ssh://provider/user/repo

    The Dagger CLI now securely forwards the SSH_AUTH_TOKEN for authentication
