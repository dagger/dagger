  Services can now be given an explicit hostname via `Service.withHostname`.

  Previously, you could only express a DAG of services, because each service hostname was derived from the service's configuration, and changing a service to point to another service would inherently change that service's configuration.

  Now you can set your own hostnames ahead of time, tell your services about each other's hostnames, and start they manually.

  Services with custom hostnames are namespaced to the module that starts them, to prevent conflicts.
