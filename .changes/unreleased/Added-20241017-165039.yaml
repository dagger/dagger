  Show disk usage metrics for execs in TUI

  The engine now supports collecting metrics from individual execs and publishing them as OTel metrics.

  To start, just disk read/write byte totals and IO pressure time are supported, but more like CPU/memory/network/etc. will be added soon.

  Currently, metrics will be displayed in the TUI at verbosity level 4 (`-vvv`).
