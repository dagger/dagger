    Custom dagger `engine.json` config file

    This new config file in `~/.config/dagger/engine.json` is intended to
    eventually replace the old buildkit-style `engine.toml` file that's
    currently used for configuration.

    This file can be either mounted directly into a manually started engine at
    `/etc/dagger/engine.toml`, or it will automatically mounted from the
    `~/.config` location when the engine is started.
