    Propagate exit codes properly in shell

    The `.exit` builtin was added.

    The `.wait` builtin now accepts a list of job ids to wait for. For example:

    ```sh
    container | from alpine | with-exec false | stdout &
    job1=$!
    container | from alpine | with-exec echo ok | stdout &
    job2=$!
    .echo ".wait $job1 $job2"
    .wait $job1 $job2
    ```
    The above example should exit with status code 1 because `.wait` returns
    the exit of the first command that failed. This is different from Bash
    which returns the exit status of the last command in the list, even if 
    it succeeded when others have failed.
