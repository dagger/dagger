body: Added a new `dots` progress format, which is a much quieter alternative to `plain` suitable for use in CI. This format focuses on printing logs and reduces everything else to just green dots and red Xes for success/failure, similar to test runners like RSpec. [Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/723921)
