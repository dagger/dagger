  dagger generate command

  Functions can be marked as 'generate' (`// +generate` in Go, `@generate()` in typescript, `@generate` in python). Those functions must expose a Changeset.
  By marking them as generate functions means they will be available under the `dagger generate` command. This command will run all of them and merge the resulting changesets before to apply it.
