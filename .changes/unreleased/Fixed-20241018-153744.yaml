  Optimize container.From for image refs with digests.

  Previously, if container.From was given an image ref with a digest and that image already existed in the local cache, the engine would still waste time resolving metadata over the network from the registry.

  Now, if a digested image ref already exists locally, the network requests are skipped entirely.
