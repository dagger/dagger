- api: Don't fallback to the default command on `stdout` and `stderr` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7857
- api: Return absolute path on export instead of boolean by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7500
- api: Align `Container.withNewFile` signature with `Directory.withNewFile` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7293
- api: Skip entrypoint by default in `withExec` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7136
- sdks: Don't return Void by @helderco in @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7773

- typescript: use `@func` instead of `@field` by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7701
- api: Removed checkVersionCompatibility field (versioning checks are now automatically performed on all connections) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7751
- api: Terminal type removed, Container.Terminal now returns a Container by @aluzzardi in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7586
- api: Removed ID parameters for Container, Directory and Socket (use loadContainerFromID, loadDirectoryFromID and loadSocketFromID respectively) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/6934
- api: Removed deprecated sshAuthSocket and sshKnownHosts args from GitRef.Tree (use these args on Git) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/6934

#### Upgrade Instructions

Thanks to the new compatibility mode feature, these breaking changes should not impact any existing Modules immediately. `dagger call` should still work on v0.12.0 without any changes to your Module code.

After upgrading to Engine v0.12.0, you can upgrade your Module to use the latest v0.12.0 APIs by running `dagger develop`. That will update the `engineVersion` field of your module's `dagger.json` configuration file to `v0.12.0` and enable the new APIs.

After that, if your code is impacted by any of the breaking changes, you will see errors when running `dagger call`. Once the errors are fixed, `dagger call` will work again and your module can be updated in Daggerverse if desired.

More detailed instructions on addressing the individual API incompatible changes can be found in the PR descriptions linked above.
