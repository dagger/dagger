## v0.12.0 - 2024-07-12

This release is significant. All details (including videos & code examples)
are captured [in this blog post](https://dagger.io/blog/dagger-0-12).

### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes

- sdk: Various breaking changes to the Go SDK \
  See the SDK-specific release notes for more information.
- api: Align `Container.withNewFile` signature with `Directory.withNewFile` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7293 \
  Callers of `Container.withNewFile` will need to change `contents` from optional to required argument.
- api: Skip entrypoint by default in `withExec` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7136 \
  Callers relying on a `Container`'s entrypoint will need to be updated
  to opt-in with `useEntrypoint`.
- api: Don't fallback to the default command on `Container.stdout` and `Container.stderr` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7857 \
  Callers of `stdout` and `stderr` without a previous `withExec` will need to
  insert an explicit empty `withExec`.
- api: `Container.terminal` now returns a `Container` by @aluzzardi in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7586 \
  Callers of `terminal` will need be updated to handle the updated type.
- api: Return absolute path on export instead of boolean by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7500 \
  Callers expecting a boolean return will need to be updated to instead
  handle a string path.
- api: Removed deprecated `sshAuthSocket` and `sshKnownHosts` args from `GitRef.tree` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/6934 \
  Callers should instead attach these arguments onto the top-level `git` call.
- api: Removed `id` parameters for `container`, `directory` and `socket` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/6934 \
  Users of these parameters should instead use the standalone
  `loadContainerFromID`, `loadDirectoryFromID` and `loadSocketFromID`
  respectively.
- api: Removed `checkVersionCompatibility` field (versioning checks are now automatically performed on all connections) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7751 \
  Versioning checks are now all automatically performed on all connections, and
  never need to be manually performed through the API.

#### Upgrade Instructions

Thanks to the new compatibility mode feature, these breaking changes should not
impact any existing Modules immediately. `dagger call` should still work on
v0.12.0 without any changes to your Module code (any compat issues for modules
are likely a bug, please report!)

After upgrading to Engine v0.12.0, you can upgrade your Module to use the
latest v0.12.0 APIs by running `dagger develop`. That will update the
`engineVersion` field of your module's `dagger.json` configuration file to
`v0.12.0` and enable the new APIs.

After that, if your code is impacted by any of the breaking changes, you will
see errors when running `dagger call`. Once the errors are fixed, `dagger call`
will work again and your module can be updated in Daggerverse if desired.

More detailed instructions on addressing the individual API incompatible
changes can be found in the PR descriptions linked above.
