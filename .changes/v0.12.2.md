## v0.12.2 - 2024-07-22


### Changed
- `dagger init` now generates files in the current directory by default and no longer in `./dagger` by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7824

### Fixed
- cli: fix handling of enum default values by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8000
- cli: fix Cloud traces and GitHub checks always being succeeded by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8001
  - note: this only affects telemetry; the command itself still fails.
