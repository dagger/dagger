## v0.12.4 - 2024-08-01


### Changed
- Deprecate old `pipeline` APIs by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8064 \
  These operations have been no-ops since v0.11.0, and will be removed in v0.13.0.

### Fixed
- Fix errors when using Dockerfile builds from module functions that have secrets by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8049
- Fix dagger `terminal` prompt with debian-based images by @vmaffet in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7960
- Fix occasional leaks in secret scrubbing algorithm by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8047
- Fix frequent context switches in `--progress=plain` output by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7956
- Extend multi git server support to Azure devOps by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8063 \
  Our support for Azure refs was broken on monorepos. We special-case Azure
  DevOps since it doesn't work with the go standard convention of discovering
  the root of a git repository
