## v0.12.5 - 2024-08-15


### Added
- cli: allow calling core functions directly by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7310 \
  Usage: `dagger core <function>` \
  Example: `dagger core container from --address=alpine terminal`

  Works the same as `dagger call`, but instead of loading a user module,
  it only uses functions from the core API.

  Run `dagger core --help` for available functions.

  _Note that this command is experimental and the DX for calling core functions
  in the CLI may change in the future._
- New SDK aliases for `elixir` and `php` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8067 \
  SDKs with experimental module support (elixir and php) can now be accessed
  using `--sdk=<sdk>` (such as `--sdk=elixir` and `--sdk=php` respectively)
  instead of the full form
  `--sdk=github.com/dagger/dagger/sdk/<sdk>@<version>`.
- Add `File.digest` method by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8114 \
  This method provides an efficient way to compute a file's digest, which
  unlock optimized file comparison or check for file changes.
- Bundle CLI in the Engine image so that both parts of Dagger (CLI+Engine) ship as a single artefact by @gerhard in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8147

### Changed
- Reimplemented the OpenTelemetry data pipeline to avoid hangs and other complications by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7996

### Fixed
- Fix `Directory.glob` to correctly handle globs with subdir prefixes by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8110 \
  Previously, attempting to glob with a prefix subdir in a pattern like
  `<subdir>/*` would not match any files. This should now be fixed, and files
  in `<subdir>` will now be correctly matched.
- Fix `failed to collect IDs from parent fields` error when module objects contain fields with nil values by @jedevc/@sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8132
- Fixed enum lists in modules by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8096
- Fixed referring to module's own objects/interfaces/enums in constructor signature by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8115 \
  Previously, modules would fail to launch if they declared a constructor that
  contained a reference to a type from it's own module in it's args.
- Fixed using custom enum types as optional arguments by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8148 \
  Previously, function calls that defined an optional argument would not be
  callable.
- Make retrieving secret from command works on Windows by @wingyplus in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8121
