## v0.12.6 - 2024-08-29


### Added
- Add new context directory support by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7744 \
  This allows accessing their own source directory, without needing to
  explicitly pass directories around.
- Support private modules with new SSH ref scheme and forward of SSH agent by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7708
  - Go-like public module refs (currently used) remain active
  - HTTP / HTTPS schemes are now supported as alternative public module refs
  - SSH refs are introduced, with support of SCP-like refs git@provider:user/repo and explicit ssh://provider/user/repo
- Implements CLI call argument `--interactive-command` for overriding the default command used in interactive mode by @samalba in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8171

### Fixed
- Error out if non-existent local module directory is passed to CLI by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8193 \
  The file-not-found errors were previously silently ignored for the top-level
  module passed in the CLI.
- Silence noisy `failed to get repo HEAD` CLI error by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8189
- Fix performance issues in `Container.withExec` after using `withMountedTemp` or `withMountedSecret` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8180
