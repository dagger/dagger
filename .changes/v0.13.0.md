## v0.13.0 - 2024-09-11


### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- Remove deprecated fields and arguments by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8065
  - Remove `Container.withExec`'s `skipEntrypoint` argument - this is now the default (see `useEntrypoint`)
  - Remove `pipeline`, `Container.pipeline` and `Directory.pipeline`
  - Remove `GitModuleSource.cloneURL` (see `GitModuleSource.cloneRef`)

### Added
- Added new `Directory.digest` and `ModuleSource.digest` fields by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8282 \
  These fields mirror the behavior of the `File.digest` field, computing a
  unique cryptographic digest over the contents of the object.
- TUI: add `--no-exit`/`-E` so you can poke around after the call completes by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8389

### Changed
- The trace url is printed just before the final output to make it easy to find by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8366 \
  Also, the url will be printed only for a subset of dagger commands to reduce noise.
- Increase the minimum connect timeout from 1s to 3s by @neutronth in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8328 \
  Connecting to a distant remote engine could otherwise fail if it was not reachable in 1s.

### Fixed
- Fixed void types from core incorrectly being seen as named scalars by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8336
- Fix setting secrets on module object in constructor by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8149
- Allow top-level field access with no constructor by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8331 \
  Previously, if a field access was made immediately after the default constructor was called, then the access would fail.
- Plain progress correctly displays carriage returns by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8347 \
  Carriage returns could previously render weirdly in the output, displaying empty lines, and similar visual glitches.
- cli: Fix default value on `Platform` flag by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8360
