## v0.13.4 - 2024-10-09


### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- Changed behavior of Git to default keep the `.git` directory by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8318 \
  This can be disabled with `tree`'s new `discardGitDir` option. Modules with
  older `engineVersion`s will keep the old behavior.
- Deprecated `git`'s `keepGitDir` argument by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8318

### Added
- Services can now be given an explicit hostname via `Service.withHostname` by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8641 \
  Previously, you could only express a DAG of services, because each service
  hostname was derived from the service's configuration, and changing a service
  to point to another service would inherently change that service's
  configuration.

  Now you can set your own hostnames ahead of time, tell your services about
  each other's hostnames, and start they manually.

  Services with custom hostnames are namespaced to the module that starts them, to prevent conflicts.
- Allow expanding environment variables in more `Container` functions by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8427
- Apply `ignore` function parameter metadata on Directory passed from the CLI by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8436 \
  This extends the usage of `ignore` to not only dir loaded with `defaultPath`
  but directory passed as function's param from the CLI.

  Note: ignore patterns are not applied for module to module calls.
- Enabled `Container.withMountedTemp` size configuration by @cwlbraa in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8652
- Add `noInit` option to `Container.withExec` to support disabling automatic init process by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8656 \
  Use cases that strictly require the user exec is PID 1 of the container are
  now supported by setting `noInit` to true.

### Fixed
- Include container annotations on `Export` and `AsTarball` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8543
- Correctly resolve relative path for modules fetched from git by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8565
- Fix include/exclude patterns from a dependency incorrectly affecting a parent module by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8575
