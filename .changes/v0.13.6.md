## v0.13.6 - 2024-10-24


### Added
- Show metrics for execs in TUI by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8506 \
  The engine now supports collecting metrics from individual execs and publishing them as OTel metrics.

  To start, just disk read/write byte totals and CPU/IO pressure time are supported, but more like memory/network/etc, will be added soon.

  Currently, metrics will be displayed in the TUI at verbosity level 4 (`-vvv`).

### Changed
- `dagger init` defaults to use `.dagger` folder during if current directory `.` is not empty by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8557
- `dagger install` now preserves the original source input, and tracks a separate `pin` field for the exact remote commit by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8587

### Fixed
- Allow custom enums that include ambiguous names (such as `true`/`false`) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8682
- Optimize `Container.from` for image refs with digests by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8736 \
  Previously, if `Container.from` was given an image ref with a digest and that image already existed in the local cache, the engine would still waste time resolving metadata over the network from the registry.

  Now, if a digested image ref already exists locally, the network requests are skipped entirely.
- Allow cloning hidden commits that are not fetched as part of a normal clone by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8747 \
  For example, `refs/pull/<pr>/head`, or `refs/pull/<pr>/merge`.
- Speed up fully cached initialize time by caching more internal SDK operations by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8735 \
  Dagger wasn't caching as many SDK operations as it could. With this change Dagger's own CI modules initialize ~1s faster when fully cached.
- Speed up initialization of modules with lots of dependencies using the Go SDK in engines with no cache by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8761 \
  Various dependencies of Go SDK modules are now pre-cached in the engine image, which avoids significant CPU pressure when building Go SDK modules in parallel with no cache.

  The engine image size increase is expected to be offset by these improvements.
