## v0.13.7 - 2024-10-31


### Added
- New `expect` arg for `Container.withExec` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8466 \
  This enum arg allows specifying valid return statuses for which the command
  can return without failing immediately.
- New `Container.exitCode` field to get the exit code of the last `withExec` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8466

### Changed
- Updated default cache policies to avoid consuming too much disk by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8725 \
  The new policies attempt to co-operate with other applications using the disk
  and will adjust its cache usage accordingly.
- cli: limit printing objects to state by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8788 \
  Previously, when a function chain in `dagger call` ended in an object, we'd
  print all functions that return a simple value and don't have any arguments.
  Now, only object fields will be included, not all functions.

### Fixed
- Fix excessive cache invalidation of `withExec`s using the `ExperimentalPrivilegedNesting` flag by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8776
