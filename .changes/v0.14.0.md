## v0.14.0 - 2024-11-08


### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- Rename `dagger-engine` core GraphQL query to `engine` by @marcosnils in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8568
- Remove deprecated `Container.withFocus` and `Container.withoutFocus` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8647

### Added
- Add support for git credential managers to retrieve Personal Access Tokens (PAT) when loading private dagger modules by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8805 \
  - Enables private git repository support for HTTP/HTTPS refs
  - Works alongside existing SSH authentication support
  - Compatible with standard git credential managers and credential helpers
  - Supports common git hosting platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)

### Fixed
- Ensure that gitdns support token support works with all Git server providers. Bitbucket Cloud requires a specific auth format for Git operations using tokens, where the username must be 'x-token-auth'. This fixes token authentication for Bitbucket while maintaining compatibility with other Git providers like GitHub and GitLab, and Azure by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8778
