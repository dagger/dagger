## v0.15.0 - 2024-12-11

### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- `Container.asService` now uses the command specified by `withDefaultArgs` instead of the last `withExec` command by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8865 \
  Users can override the args by providing the `args` option to `asService`.
  They can also configure the container to use the container entrypoint by using
  `useEntrypoint` option.

### Added
- Better TUI errors, new cached/pending states, duration accounting and fewer spans by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8442
- Custom dagger `engine.json` config file by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8800 \
  This new config file format is intended to eventually replace the old
  buildkit-style `engine.toml` file that's currently used for configuration.

  This file can be either mounted directly into a manually started engine at
  `/etc/dagger/engine.toml`, or it will automatically mounted from the
  user's `~/.config/dagger/engine.json` when the engine is started.
- Filesync performance is improved by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8818 \
  The engine now re-uses previously loaded data more reliably and in more
  cases, which speeds up repeated reloads of the same or similar (i.e.
  overlapping data).

  Uncached filesyncs of large amounts of data is also faster and uses less
  memory in the engine.
- Added `dagger uninstall` command to remove a dependency by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8745
- Added memory and network telemetry for execs by @cwlbraa in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8880 https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8902
- Added `DAGGER_LEAVE_OLD_ENGINE` environment variable to optionally prevent removal of old engine containers during upgrades by [devin](https://github.com/apps/devin-ai-integration) in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8195

### Fixed
- `Directory.terminal` API works now by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8952
- Fix resource leaks in the engine that occurred after each debug terminal was opened by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9013
- Fix cache mounts not being included in interactive debug containers by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9034
- Allow `Container.withExec` `expect` to catch exit code 128 by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9027
- Correctly apply ignore pattern when pulling a directory from git by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8931
- Fix panic on null `Directory.digest` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8946
