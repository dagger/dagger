## v0.17.1 - 2025-03-24

- BREAKING(llm): fix go sdk capitalization of "Llm" to "LLM" instead, consistent with engine code and the rest of the go ecosystem (https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9933)
    - this will break compilation of modules referencing the LLM API like `dag.Llm`. To fix, simply change to `dag.LLM`
- when prompting for remote module LLM access, error early in non-interactive situations where we would previously hang indefinitely. (https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9957)
