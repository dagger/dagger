## v0.17.2 - 2025-03-27

### Added
- New `Directory.filter` API for improved ergonomics by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9976 \
  This was previously possible by doing `Query.directory.withDirectory("", dir)`, but this breaks the chain.

### Changed
- Various LLM API changes and improvements to tool calling scheme by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9956
