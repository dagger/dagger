## v0.18.10 - 2025-06-10

### Added
- Improved TUI progress visualizer by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10468
- Added `E` hotkey in TUI for `-E`/`--no-exit` at runtime by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10511
- Add support for using engine-wide default GC policy when triggering manual local cache prunes by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10505 \
  The manual prune API now supports an optional arg to enable honoring the engine-wide default automatic GC configuration. e.g.
  ```
  dagger core engine local-cache prune --use-default-policy
  ```
- New `container.WithSymlink` and `directory.WithSymlink` API for creating symbolic links by @alexcb in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10435
- Unbundle the SDK interface to support partial implementation by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10525 \
  When you implement a custom SDK, you can now choose to just implement part of the `SDK` interface depending on your needs.
  That means:
  - `dagger develop` no longer fails if your SDK just implement the `Runtime` interface, it will simply not call `Codegen` if not defined.
  - `dagger call` and `dagger functions` give a clear error message if it's not supported by the SDK.

  See https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/7707 for more information.
