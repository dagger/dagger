## v0.18.11 - 2025-06-25

### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- The dagger CLI and shell must now be passed enums by name (instead of by
  value) for SDKs that support enum members (see SDK-specific release notes).
- Default arguments are now validated on registration by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9518 \
  This may break loading modules (including in compat mode) that were
  previously setting enum default values in function signatures, if those values
  weren't valid - these would only trigger an error on calling that function,
  while now it's triggered during module initialization.
- Remove `namespace` argument from `CacheVolume` by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10586 \
  This arg was only ever meant for internal usage within the API's
  implementation, but previously couldn't be hidden from the public API. Now it
  is properly internal-only and thus not accessible to external clients. Any use
  of the arg should just be removed.
- Changed incorrect `sweep` engine option name to `sweepSize` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10560
  This option was previously incorrectly named - the docs were correct, but the
  code was not properly updated.

### Added
- New top-level `cloud` API for getting information about the dagger cloud session by @marcosnils in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10580 \
  This includes the `cloud.traceURL` field for getting the current trace URL.
- Allow `--no-mod`/`-M` flag in more places to disable automatic module loading by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10595
- Propagate exit codes properly in shell by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10438 \
  The `.exit` builtin was added.

  The `.wait` builtin now accepts a list of job ids to wait for. For example:

  ```sh
  container | from alpine | with-exec false | stdout &
  job1=$!
  container | from alpine | with-exec echo ok | stdout &
  job2=$!
  .echo ".wait $job1 $job2"
  .wait $job1 $job2
  ```

  The above example should exit with status code 1 because `.wait` returns
  the exit of the first command that failed. This is different from Bash
  which returns the exit status of the last command in the list, even if
  it succeeded when others have failed.
- Add `httpAuthUsername` parameter to `git` to allow basic auth with usernames by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10605 \
  Additionally this field is populated from the client's git credential helper,
  similarly to passwords.
- You can now set `$DAGGER_PROGRESS` to configure your preferred progress format globally, instead of passing the `--progress` flag every time by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10617
- Added a new `dots` progress format, which is a much quieter alternative to `plain` suitable for use in CI by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10617
  This format focuses on printing logs and reduces everything else to just
  green dots and red Xes for success/failure, similar to test runners like RSpec.

### Changed
- shell: use main object description as the fallback in `.help <module>` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10487
- When a service fails to start, the API will now return a proper `ExecError` so you can see the stdout/stderr and exit code programmatically by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10585

### Fixed
- Fixed high engine memory usage exacerbated by high log volume and composing multiple modules by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10578 \
  In one scenario this reduced heap usage from 14GB to 7GB.
- Schema introspection is now cached, as long as the schema doesn't change by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10579 \
  In the same scenario as the high log volume fix, this further reduced heap usage from 7GB to 1.4GB.
- shell: fixed arguments with pipelines to interpreter builtins not being resolved by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10635
- Fixed the `plain` progress format being way more verbose than intended by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10636
- Fixed `Directory.withSymlink` accidentally escaping from the selected sub-directory by @alexcb in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10563
