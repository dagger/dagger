## v0.18.12 - 2025-06-27

### Changed
- Ignore default OrbStack CA cert for automatic installation by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10648 \
  OrbStack users were by default ending up with a custom CA in their engine and automatically installed in each container, adding overhead. We now ignore that CA cert by default to improve performance in the default case.

### Fixed
- Fixed a deadlock caused by concurrent schema introspection and modification by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10643
- Fixed an issue where old dagger versions would create an invalid typedef when the enum name equaled the enum value by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10647
- Fixed an issue where an issue where --help for enum default values was incorrect @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10647
