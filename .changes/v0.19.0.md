## v0.19.0 - 2025-09-30

### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- `GitRepository.branch`/`GitRepository.tag`/`GitRepository.commit` now only accept valid branches/tags/commits by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11038
- `GitRepository`'s `withAuthToken` and `withAuthHeader` are now no-ops by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11032 \
  Instead authentication should *only* be provided at the top-level `git` query, since it's now queried immediately.
- Remove deprecated `Host.setSecretFile` method by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11115 \
  Use the `file://` secret provider instead.
- Remove `LocalCache.keepBytes` field by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11115 \
  Instead use the more specific `LocalCache.reservedSpace`, which it was an alias for.
- Removed deprecated `Container.build` API by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11118 \
  Use `Directory.dockerBuild` instead.

### Added
