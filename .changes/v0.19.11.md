## v0.19.11 - 2026-02-05

### Added
- Merge multiple changesets using changeset.withChangset(other) or changeset.withChangesets(others...) by @eunomie in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11577 \
  Multiple strategies are available in case of conflict, and uses git under the hood to merge the changesets.
- Add dagger generate command by @eunomie in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11779 \
  Functions can be marked as 'generate' (`// +generate` in Go, `@generate()` in typescript, `@generate` in python). Those functions must expose a Changeset.
  By marking them as generate functions means they will be available under the `dagger generate` command. This command will run all of them and merge the resulting changesets before to apply it.
