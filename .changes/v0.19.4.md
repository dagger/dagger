## v0.19.4 - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Function cache control by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10975 \
  Function calls now have configurable caching behavior, including TTLs. Function calls with cached results can skip execution, which often significantly speeds up your workflows. Instructions and more details on the configuration options can be found in the [docs](https://docs.dagger.io/extending/function-caching). \
  ðŸš¨ Modules initialized before v0.19.4 [will need to explicitly opt-in to the new caching behavior](https://docs.dagger.io/extending/function-caching/#backwards-compatibility).
