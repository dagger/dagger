## v0.19.9 - 2026-01-07

### Added
- directory.Stat and container.Stat calls by @alexcb in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11403
- improve filesystem performance by reducing overlay fsync overhead by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11559
- improve changeset performance by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11580
- add Check.Source to return the module source where the check is defined by @tiborvass in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11630

### Fixed
- fix TypeScript cache setting type error by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11539
- Disable Git askpass prompts to prevent unexpected IDE credential dialogs (e.g., VS Code popups that appear even when credentials are already configured). Credentials still work via helpers or .netrc. For the rare case where no credentials are configured, Dagger now fails early with a clear error instead of triggering a subtle prompt that users sometimes miss by @sleiner-v in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11437
- fix invalid overlay mount creation race condition by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11545
- template in module name when initializing typescript modules by @kpenfound in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11551
- fix incorrect file contents caching race condition bug by @alexcb in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11575
- allow use of git module sources in Java SDK by @eunomie in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11570
- improve determinism of generate Go code by @kpenfound in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11579
- preserve shell exit codes in TUI mode by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11586
- ensure typescript SDK correctly uses lockfile in modules by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11592
- fix chained calls across different depths in progress output by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11596
- correct spelling in withAnnotation doc by @hugginsio in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/11598
