  # This runs on a schedule by default:
  schedule:
    # https://crontab.guru/#6_17_*_*_2
    # Every Tuesday at 5:06pm UTC & 9:06am US West Coast.
    # GitHub Actions defaults to UTC:
    - cron: "6 17 * * 2"
    # There is high load on GitHub Actions at the top of the hour:
    #
    #     Note: The schedule event can be delayed during periods of high loads of
    #     GitHub Actions workflow runs. High load times include the start of every
    #     hour. To decrease the chance of delay, schedule your workflow to run at a
    #     different time of the hour.
    #
    # So we run these at a special time, 9:06. Ask @gerhard about it.

  # And it also supports manual triggering:
