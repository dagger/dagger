- When committing always sign-off with 'git commit -s'. Never include advertisements for your coding agent product (eg. "co-authored-by: Claude" and other nonsense)
- DRY is very important. Always double-check your solution for DRY violations. Assume you are brilliant at producing working code, but have a well-known flaw which makes you forget DRY. You are working on this flaw.
- Simplicity of design is important. Always double-check your solution for possible simplification. Don't take it too far - correctness and performance are even more important. But assume that your first solution is overcomplicated.
- API is UX - including internal API. The breakdown and names you choose for types and functions are important. Humans will read them, and try to model how the system works in their head. If they can't because breakdown is insane and naming verbose and inconsistent: you have failed, even if your code works perfectly.
- Dagger is split between CLI and Engine. In doubt, err on the side of making the CLI dumber, and the engine smarter. This is a non-obvious tradeoff, and has exceptions. Don't blindly execute: simply be aware of historical precedents and design preference, and actively discuss tradeoffs.
