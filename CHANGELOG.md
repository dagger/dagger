## v0.14.0 - 2024-11-08


### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- Rename `dagger-engine` core GraphQL query to `engine` by @marcosnils in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8568
- Remove deprecated `Container.withFocus` and `Container.withoutFocus` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8647

### Added
- Add support for git credential managers to retrieve Personal Access Tokens (PAT) when loading private dagger modules by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8805 \
  - Enables private git repository support for HTTP/HTTPS refs
  - Works alongside existing SSH authentication support
  - Compatible with standard git credential managers and credential helpers
  - Supports common git hosting platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)

### Fixed
- Ensure that gitdns support token support works with all Git server providers. Bitbucket Cloud requires a specific auth format for Git operations using tokens, where the username must be 'x-token-auth'. This fixes token authentication for Bitbucket while maintaining compatibility with other Git providers like GitHub and GitLab, and Azure by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8778

## v0.13.7 - 2024-10-31


### Added
- New `expect` arg for `Container.withExec` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8466 \
  This enum arg allows specifying valid return statuses for which the command
  can return without failing immediately.
- New `Container.exitCode` field to get the exit code of the last `withExec` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8466

### Changed
- Updated default cache policies to avoid consuming too much disk by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8725 \
  The new policies attempt to co-operate with other applications using the disk
  and will adjust its cache usage accordingly.
- cli: limit printing objects to state by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8788 \
  Previously, when a function chain in `dagger call` ended in an object, we'd
  print all functions that return a simple value and don't have any arguments.
  Now, only object fields will be included, not all functions.

### Fixed
- Fix excessive cache invalidation of `withExec`s using the `ExperimentalPrivilegedNesting` flag by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8776

## v0.13.6 - 2024-10-24


### Added
- Show metrics for execs in TUI by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8506 \
  The engine now supports collecting metrics from individual execs and publishing them as OTel metrics.

  To start, just disk read/write byte totals and CPU/IO pressure time are supported, but more like memory/network/etc, will be added soon.

  Currently, metrics will be displayed in the TUI at verbosity level 4 (`-vvv`).

### Changed
- `dagger init` defaults to use `.dagger` folder during if current directory `.` is not empty by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8557
- `dagger install` now preserves the original source input, and tracks a separate `pin` field for the exact remote commit by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8587

### Fixed
- Allow custom enums that include ambiguous names (such as `true`/`false`) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8682
- Optimize `Container.from` for image refs with digests by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8736 \
  Previously, if `Container.from` was given an image ref with a digest and that image already existed in the local cache, the engine would still waste time resolving metadata over the network from the registry.

  Now, if a digested image ref already exists locally, the network requests are skipped entirely.
- Allow cloning hidden commits that are not fetched as part of a normal clone by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8747 \
  For example, `refs/pull/<pr>/head`, or `refs/pull/<pr>/merge`.
- Speed up fully cached initialize time by caching more internal SDK operations by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8735 \
  Dagger wasn't caching as many SDK operations as it could. With this change Dagger's own CI modules initialize ~1s faster when fully cached.
- Speed up initialization of modules with lots of dependencies using the Go SDK in engines with no cache by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8761 \
  Various dependencies of Go SDK modules are now pre-cached in the engine image, which avoids significant CPU pressure when building Go SDK modules in parallel with no cache.

  The engine image size increase is expected to be offset by these improvements.

## v0.13.4 - 2024-10-09


### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- Changed behavior of Git to default keep the `.git` directory by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8318 \
  This can be disabled with `tree`'s new `discardGitDir` option. Modules with
  older `engineVersion`s will keep the old behavior.
- Deprecated `git`'s `keepGitDir` argument by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8318

### Added
- Services can now be given an explicit hostname via `Service.withHostname` by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8641 \
  Previously, you could only express a DAG of services, because each service
  hostname was derived from the service's configuration, and changing a service
  to point to another service would inherently change that service's
  configuration.

  Now you can set your own hostnames ahead of time, tell your services about
  each other's hostnames, and start they manually.

  Services with custom hostnames are namespaced to the module that starts them, to prevent conflicts.
- Allow expanding environment variables in more `Container` functions by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8427
- Apply `ignore` function parameter metadata on Directory passed from the CLI by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8436 \
  This extends the usage of `ignore` to not only dir loaded with `defaultPath`
  but directory passed as function's param from the CLI.

  Note: ignore patterns are not applied for module to module calls.
- Enabled `Container.withMountedTemp` size configuration by @cwlbraa in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8652
- Add `noInit` option to `Container.withExec` to support disabling automatic init process by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8656 \
  Use cases that strictly require the user exec is PID 1 of the container are
  now supported by setting `noInit` to true.

### Fixed
- Include container annotations on `Export` and `AsTarball` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8543
- Correctly resolve relative path for modules fetched from git by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8565
- Fix include/exclude patterns from a dependency incorrectly affecting a parent module by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8575

## v0.13.2 - 2024-09-20


### Added
- New `Container.up` API by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8479 \
  This is an alias to `.AsService().Up()`.

### Fixed
- removed noisy "check for updates" span by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8491

## v0.13.1 - 2024-09-18


### Added
- Added new methods `Container.withoutFiles` and `Directory.withoutFiles` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8216
- Add `Container.withAnnotation` to set OCI annotations by @aluzzardi in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8409
- `ignore` combined with `defaultPath` now works if the module is fetch from git instead of local by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8430
- New `Directory.withoutFiles` and `Container.withoutFiles` core APIs by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8216 \
  These can be used to remove multiple files from a filesystem in one call.

### Fixed
- Fix `Directory.digest` on scratch directory by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8445
- Allow private secrets to pass between different modules by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8358
- Handle session-wide cached functions that return secrets by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8358

## v0.13.0 - 2024-09-11


### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- Remove deprecated fields and arguments by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8065
  - Remove `Container.withExec`'s `skipEntrypoint` argument - this is now the default (see `useEntrypoint`)
  - Remove `pipeline`, `Container.pipeline` and `Directory.pipeline`
  - Remove `GitModuleSource.cloneURL` (see `GitModuleSource.cloneRef`)

### Added
- Added new `Directory.digest` and `ModuleSource.digest` fields by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8282 \
  These fields mirror the behavior of the `File.digest` field, computing a
  unique cryptographic digest over the contents of the object.
- TUI: add `--no-exit`/`-E` so you can poke around after the call completes by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8389

### Changed
- The trace url is printed just before the final output to make it easy to find by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8366 \
  Also, the url will be printed only for a subset of dagger commands to reduce noise.
- Increase the minimum connect timeout from 1s to 3s by @neutronth in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8328 \
  Connecting to a distant remote engine could otherwise fail if it was not reachable in 1s.

### Fixed
- Fixed void types from core incorrectly being seen as named scalars by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8336
- Fix setting secrets on module object in constructor by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8149
- Allow top-level field access with no constructor by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8331 \
  Previously, if a field access was made immediately after the default constructor was called, then the access would fail.
- Plain progress correctly displays carriage returns by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8347 \
  Carriage returns could previously render weirdly in the output, displaying empty lines, and similar visual glitches.
- cli: Fix default value on `Platform` flag by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8360

## v0.12.6 - 2024-08-29


### Added
- Add new context directory support by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7744 \
  This allows accessing their own source directory, without needing to
  explicitly pass directories around.
- Support private modules with new SSH ref scheme and forward of SSH agent by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7708
  - Go-like public module refs (currently used) remain active
  - HTTP / HTTPS schemes are now supported as alternative public module refs
  - SSH refs are introduced, with support of SCP-like refs git@provider:user/repo and explicit ssh://provider/user/repo
- Implements CLI call argument `--interactive-command` for overriding the default command used in interactive mode by @samalba in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8171

### Fixed
- Error out if non-existent local module directory is passed to CLI by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8193 \
  The file-not-found errors were previously silently ignored for the top-level
  module passed in the CLI.
- Silence noisy `failed to get repo HEAD` CLI error by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8189
- Fix performance issues in `Container.withExec` after using `withMountedTemp` or `withMountedSecret` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8180

## v0.12.5 - 2024-08-15


### Added
- cli: allow calling core functions directly by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7310 \
  Usage: `dagger core <function>` \
  Example: `dagger core container from --address=alpine terminal`

  Works the same as `dagger call`, but instead of loading a user module,
  it only uses functions from the core API.

  Run `dagger core --help` for available functions.

  _Note that this command is experimental and the DX for calling core functions
  in the CLI may change in the future._
- New SDK aliases for `elixir` and `php` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8067 \
  SDKs with experimental module support (elixir and php) can now be accessed
  using `--sdk=<sdk>` (such as `--sdk=elixir` and `--sdk=php` respectively)
  instead of the full form
  `--sdk=github.com/dagger/dagger/sdk/<sdk>@<version>`.
- Add `File.digest` method by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8114 \
  This method provides an efficient way to compute a file's digest, which
  unlock optimized file comparison or check for file changes.
- Bundle CLI in the Engine image so that both parts of Dagger (CLI+Engine) ship as a single artefact by @gerhard in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8147

### Changed
- Reimplemented the OpenTelemetry data pipeline to avoid hangs and other complications by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7996

### Fixed
- Fix `Directory.glob` to correctly handle globs with subdir prefixes by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8110 \
  Previously, attempting to glob with a prefix subdir in a pattern like
  `<subdir>/*` would not match any files. This should now be fixed, and files
  in `<subdir>` will now be correctly matched.
- Fix `failed to collect IDs from parent fields` error when module objects contain fields with nil values by @jedevc/@sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8132
- Fixed enum lists in modules by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8096
- Fixed referring to module's own objects/interfaces/enums in constructor signature by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8115 \
  Previously, modules would fail to launch if they declared a constructor that
  contained a reference to a type from it's own module in it's args.
- Fixed using custom enum types as optional arguments by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8148 \
  Previously, function calls that defined an optional argument would not be
  callable.
- Make retrieving secret from command works on Windows by @wingyplus in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8121

## v0.12.4 - 2024-08-01


### Changed
- Deprecate old `pipeline` APIs by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8064 \
  These operations have been no-ops since v0.11.0, and will be removed in v0.13.0.

### Fixed
- Fix errors when using Dockerfile builds from module functions that have secrets by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8049
- Fix dagger `terminal` prompt with debian-based images by @vmaffet in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7960
- Fix occasional leaks in secret scrubbing algorithm by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8047
- Fix frequent context switches in `--progress=plain` output by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7956
- Extend multi git server support to Azure devOps by @grouville in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8063 \
  Our support for Azure refs was broken on monorepos. We special-case Azure
  DevOps since it doesn't work with the go standard convention of discovering
  the root of a git repository

### Changed
- `dagger init` now generates files in the current directory by default and no longer in `./dagger` by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7824

### Fixed
- cli: fix handling of enum default values by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8000
- cli: fix Cloud traces and GitHub checks always being succeeded by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8001
  - note: this only affects telemetry; the command itself still fails.

## v0.12.0 - 2024-07-12

This release is significant. All details (including videos & code examples)
are captured [in this blog post](https://dagger.io/blog/dagger-0-12).

### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes

- sdk: Various breaking changes to the Go SDK \
  See the SDK-specific release notes for more information.
- api: Align `Container.withNewFile` signature with `Directory.withNewFile` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7293 \
  Callers of `Container.withNewFile` will need to change `contents` from optional to required argument.
- api: Skip entrypoint by default in `withExec` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7136 \
  Callers relying on a `Container`'s entrypoint will need to be updated
  to opt-in with `useEntrypoint`.
- api: Don't fallback to the default command on `Container.stdout` and `Container.stderr` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7857 \
  Callers of `stdout` and `stderr` without a previous `withExec` will need to
  insert an explicit empty `withExec`.
- api: `Container.terminal` now returns a `Container` by @aluzzardi in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7586 \
  Callers of `terminal` will need be updated to handle the updated type.
- api: Return absolute path on export instead of boolean by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7500 \
  Callers expecting a boolean return will need to be updated to instead
  handle a string path.
- api: Removed deprecated `sshAuthSocket` and `sshKnownHosts` args from `GitRef.tree` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/6934 \
  Callers should instead attach these arguments onto the top-level `git` call.
- api: Removed `id` parameters for `container`, `directory` and `socket` by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/6934 \
  Users of these parameters should instead use the standalone
  `loadContainerFromID`, `loadDirectoryFromID` and `loadSocketFromID`
  respectively.
- api: Removed `checkVersionCompatibility` field (versioning checks are now automatically performed on all connections) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7751 \
  Versioning checks are now all automatically performed on all connections, and
  never need to be manually performed through the API.

#### Upgrade Instructions

Thanks to the new compatibility mode feature, these breaking changes should not
impact any existing Modules immediately. `dagger call` should still work on
v0.12.0 without any changes to your Module code (any compat issues for modules
are likely a bug, please report!)

After upgrading to Engine v0.12.0, you can upgrade your Module to use the
latest v0.12.0 APIs by running `dagger develop`. That will update the
`engineVersion` field of your module's `dagger.json` configuration file to
`v0.12.0` and enable the new APIs.

After that, if your code is impacted by any of the breaking changes, you will
see errors when running `dagger call`. Once the errors are fixed, `dagger call`
will work again and your module can be updated in Daggerverse if desired.

More detailed instructions on addressing the individual API incompatible
changes can be found in the PR descriptions linked above.
