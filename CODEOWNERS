# CODEOWNERS is a tool to encode PR approval rules.
#
# When a PR is opened, at least one code owner is required to approve it
# before being merged.
#
# It does **not**:
#
# - Limit reviewers: Everyone is welcome and encouraged to review any PR.
#   But at least one CODEOWNER must approve before merging.
#
# - Limit contributions or ownership: Every maintainer is responsible for
#   the entire project. CODEOWNERs are there to review PRs for
#   consistency.
#
# By default, any maintainer can approve any PR. There's a couple of
# exceptions for consistency/specialty.

# Default owners for everything in the repo
# Later matches takes precedence
