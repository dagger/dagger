# Contributing to Dagger

As an open source project, Dagger welcomes all contributions.

Examples:

- Opening issues for bug reports, feature requests or general feedback
- Creating pull requests for code or documentation improvements
- Reviewing and discussing open issues and pull requests
- Helping other users

When it comes to pull requests, the bigger the contribution, the earlier you should talk to maintainers to make sure you're taking the right approach and are not wasting your effort on something that will not get merged.

Extensive contribution guidelines are available in the repository at `docs/guides/1227-contributing.md`, or online at:
