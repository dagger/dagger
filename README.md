## What is Dagger?

Dagger is a programmable CI/CD engine that runs your pipelines in containers.

### Programmable

Develop your CI/CD pipelines as code, in the same programming language as your application.

### Runs your pipelines in containers

Dagger executes your pipelines entirely asÂ [standard OCI containers](https://opencontainers.org/). This has several benefits:

* **Instant local testing**
* **Portability**: the same pipeline can run on your local machine, a CI runner, a dedicated server, or any container hosting service.
* **Superior caching**: every operation is cached by default, and caching works the same everywhere
* **Compatibility** with the Docker ecosystem: if it runs in a container, you can add it to your pipeline.
* **Cross-language instrumentation**: teams can use each other's tools without learning each other's language.

## Who is it for?

Dagger may be a good fit if you are...

* A developer wishing your CI pipelines were code instead of YAML
* Your team's "designated devops person", hoping to replace a pile of artisanal scripts with something more powerful
* A platform engineer writing custom tooling, with the goal of unifying continuous delivery across organizational silos
* A cloud-native developer advocate or solutions engineer, looking to demonstrate a complex integration on short notice
