## What is Dagger?

Dagger is an open-source runtime for composable workflows. It's perfect for systems with many moving parts and a strong need for **repeatability**, **modularity**, **observability** and **cross-platform support**. This makes it a great choice for AI agents and CI/CD workflows.

## Key Features

- **Containerized Workflow Execution:** Transform code into containerized, composable operations. Build reproducible workflows in any language with custom environments, parallel processing, and seamless chaining.

- **Universal Type System:** Mix and match components from any language with type-safe connections. Use the best tools from each ecosystem without translation headaches.

- **Automatic Artifact Caching:** Operations produce cacheable, immutable artifacts — even for LLMs and API calls. Your workflows run faster and cost less.

- **Built-in Observability:** Full visibility into operations with tracing, logs, and metrics. Debug complex workflows and know exactly what's happening.

- **Open Platform:** Works with any compute platform and tech stack — today and tomorrow. Ship faster, experiment freely, and don’t get locked into someone else's choices.

- **LLM Augmentation:** Native integration of any LLM that automatically discovers and uses available functions in your workflow. Ship mind-blowing agents in just a few dozen lines of code.

- **Interactive Terminal:** Directly interact with your workflow or agents in real-time through your terminal. Prototype, test, debug, and ship even faster.
