I can read logs from executions and check user-provided values. \n\nI see you've provided a cache-busting string value (UUID: 5273d910-f7d8-40c0-ae1d-e7c50000cb52), though it sounds like that's just for system purposes rather than something you need help with directly.\n\nHow can I assist you today? Would you like me to read some logs or help you with something else?",
