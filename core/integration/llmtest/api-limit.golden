    "content": "The `PATH` variable is an environment variable in Unix and Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux and macOS), as well as in Windows, that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files. Its value is a list of directories separated by colons (`:`) on Unix-like systems or semicolons (`;`) on Windows.\n\nThe specific value of `PATH` can vary depending on the system and the user's configuration, but here is a typical example for a Unix-like system:\n\n```\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin\n```\n\nAnd for Windows, it might look like:\n\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32;C:\\Windows;C:\\Program Files\n```\n\nTo find the actual value of `PATH` on your system, you can open a terminal or command prompt and type `echo $PATH` on Unix-like systems or `echo %PATH%` on Windows.",

This variable tells applications how to interact with the terminal interface, particularly in terms of capabilities like color support, cursor movement, and screen manipulation.\n\nThe value of `TERM` can vary depending on the terminal emulator or environment you are using. Here are some common values:\n\n- `xterm`: A common default for many terminal emulators.\n- `xterm-256color`: Similar to `xterm` but with support for 256 colors.\n- `screen`: Used when running in a terminal multiplexer like GNU Screen.\n- `tmux`: Used when running inside the tmux terminal multiplexer.\n- `linux`: Used on the Linux console.\n- `vt100`: Emulates a VT100 terminal, often used for basic terminal compatibility.\n\nTo find the actual value of `TERM` on your system, you can open a terminal and type `echo $TERM`.",
