# Instructions

To complete your task:
1. Discover available methods using `list_methods`
2. Select methods using `select_methods` before you can call them
3. Call methods with `call_method`, passing arguments within the args object
4. Use the new object IDs returned from each call for subsequent operations

Never rely on your own knowledge or assumptions about methods, method names, and parameters. Always list and select methods before calling them.
