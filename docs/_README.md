# FAQ

The intent behind this README is to answer contributor questions regarding [docs.dagger.io](https://docs.dagger.io).

## What is the structure of the documentation in the repository?

The documentation website (source code, assets and content) live in the `/docs` directory.

Within this directory, the content is separated into:

- `/current_docs`: the current docs shown on docs.dagger.io
- `/versioned_docs`: the next version(s) of the docs
- `/archived_docs`: the site template for the docs archive. Related instructions are in [ARCHIVING.md](./ARCHIVING.md)

## What happens to a new doc page after the PR gets merged?

It gets automatically deployed to [devel.docs.dagger.io](https://devel.docs.dagger.io).

The doc URL will use the `slug` property from the doc markdown metadata.

Given `slug: /1001/install/`, the live URL will be [devel.docs.dagger.io/1001/install](https://devel.docs.dagger.io/1001/install)

It must be manually deployed to [docs.dagger.io](https://docs.dagger.io).Only a certain group of people can deploy via Netlify. For those with permission, follow these steps:

1. Go to Nelify and login. If you are on the Dagger team and need creds, you need to make a request with Infra using the linear template.
2. Go to "Dagger team" and click on "docs.dagger.io"
3. Click on the latest commit box to see the deploy details
4. Click on "publish deploy"

## How can I test my docs change/PR?

### Locally

You will need to have `yarn` and Node.js v18 installed.

From the `/docs` directory, run the following command: `yarn install && yarn start`

This will install all dependencies, start the docs web server locally and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

### With a Dagger module

```console
# test PR 7422
dagger call -m github.com/dagger/dagger@pull/7422/head --source https://github.com/dagger/dagger#pull/7422/head docs server as-service up

## get markdown lint report for PR 7422
dagger call -m github.com/dagger/dagger/linters/markdown \
 lint --source https://github.com/dagger/dagger#pull/7422/head \
 json
```

## What else should I keep in mind as I add new doc pages?
