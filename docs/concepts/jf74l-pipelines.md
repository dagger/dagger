# Dagger Pipelines

The Dagger API allows composing a large pipeline from smaller ones. The component pipelines may be defined inline, or imported from an extension. Pipeline composition happens at the API layer, and is therefore language-agnostic. Any Dagger pipeline can be composed of any other Dagger pipelines, as long as they have compatible inputs and outputs.
