# A Dagger Plan orchestrates the Actions

## Plan structure

A config declared in Dagger starts with a plan, specifically `dagger.#Plan`

Within this plan we can:

- interact with the `client` filesystem
  - read files, usually the current directory as `.`
  - write files, usually the build output as `_build`
- read `env` variables, such as `NETLIFY_TEAM` in our example
- declare a few `actions`, e.g. `deps`, `test` & `build`

This is our **Getting Started** todoapp plan structure:

```cue file=../tests/core-concepts/plan/structure.cue.fragment

```

When the above plan gets executed via `dagger do build`, it produces the following output:

```shell
[✔] client.filesystem.".".read                               0.0s
[✔] actions.deps                                             1.1s
[✔] actions.test.script                                      0.0s
[✔] actions.test                                             0.0s
[✔] actions.build.run.script                                 0.0s
[✔] actions.build.run                                        0.0s
[✔] actions.build.contents                                   0.0s
[✔] client.filesystem."./_build".write                       0.1s
```

Since these actions have run before, they are cached and take less than 2 seconds to complete.

While the names used for the actions above - `deps`, `test` & `build` - are short and descriptive,
any other names would have worked. Put differently, action naming does not affect plan execution.

Lastly, notice that even if the `deploy` action is defined, we did not run it.
Similar to Makefile targets, we have the option of running specific actions.

We ran the `dagger do build` command, which only runs the `build` action (and all its dependent actions).
This Dagger property enables us to keep the entire CI/CD config in a single file, while keeping the integration execution separate from the deployment one.
Separating CI & CD concerns becomes essential as our pipelines grow in complexity, and we learn about operational and security constraints specific to our systems.

## Packages & imports

In order to understand the correlation between actions, definitions and packages, let us focus on the following fragment from our **Getting Started** todoapp config:

```cue
package todoapp

import (
  "dagger.io/dagger"
  "universe.dagger.io/netlify"
)

dagger.#Plan & {
  // ...
  actions: {
    // ...
    deploy: netlify.#Deploy & {
      // ...
    }
  // ...
  }
}
```

We start by declaring the package name, `package todoapp` above.

Next, we import the packages that we use in our plan.

The first import is needed for the `dagger.#Plan` definition to be available.

The second import is for `netlify.#Deploy` to work.

Which other imports we are missing?
Look at all the actions in the plan structure at the top of this page.
<DaggerVersionLatestReleased>
{daggerVersionLatestRelease =>
<>Now check all the available packages in <a href={`https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/${daggerVersionLatestRelease}/pkg/universe.dagger.io`}>universe.dagger.io</a>.</>
}
</DaggerVersionLatestReleased>
:::

We now understand that the `deploy` action is the deploy definition from the netlify package, written as `deploy: netlify.#Deploy`

Each definition has default values that can be modified via curly brackets. This is what that looks like in practice for our deploy action:

```cue
// ...
deploy: netlify.#Deploy & {
  contents: build.contents.output
  site:     client.env.APP_NAME
  token:    client.env.NETLIFY_TOKEN
  team:     client.env.NETLIFY_TEAM
}
// ...
```

We can build complex pipelines efficiently by referencing any definition, from any package in our actions.
This is one of the fundamental concepts that makes Dagger a powerful language for building CI/CD pipelines.

If you want to learn more about packages in the context of CUE, the config language used by Dagger configs, check out the [Packages](1215-what-is-cue.md#packages) section on the **What is CUE?** page.

:::tip
Now that we understand the basics of a Dagger plan, we are ready to learn more about how to interact with the client environment.
We can read the env (including secrets), run commands, use local sockets, etc.
