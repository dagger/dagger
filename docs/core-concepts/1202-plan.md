# It all starts with a plan

A CI/CD pipeline declared in Dagger starts with a plan, specifically `dagger.#Plan`

This plan is the entrypoint for everything that runs within a pipeline. The simplest plan will usually:

- interact with the client filesystem to read (e.g. source code) or write files (e.g. build output)
- read environment variables
- declare a few actions, e.g. deps, test & build

This is our **Getting Started** example app plan structure:

```cue file=../tests/core-concepts/plan/structure.cue.fragment
```

When the above plan gets executed via `dagger do build`, it produces the following output:

```shell
[✔] client.filesystem.".".read                                    0.0s
[✔] actions.deps                                                  1.1s
[✔] actions.test.script                                           0.0s
[✔] actions.test                                                  0.0s
[✔] actions.build.run.script                                      0.0s
[✔] actions.build.run                                             0.0s
[✔] actions.build.contents                                        0.0s
[✔] client.filesystem.build.write                                 0.1s
```

Since these actions have run before, they are cached and take less than 1 second to complete.

While the names used for the actions above - `deps`, `test` & `build` - are short & descriptive,
any other names would have worked. Put differently, action naming does not affect plan execution.

In the example above, the `deps` action is an instance of the docker package build definition.

This is written as `deps: docker.#Build`

Default definition configuration - `docker.#Build` in this case - can be modified via curly brackets, e.g.

```cue
    deps: docker.#Build & {
      // ...
    }
```

We can build complex pipelines efficiently by referencing any definition, from any package in our actions.
This is one of the fundamental concepts that makes Dagger a powerful language for CI/CD.
Before we can use a package in a plan, we need to declare it at the top of the pipeline configuration, like this:

```cue
import (
  "universe.dagger.io/docker"
)
```

Since we are using the plan definition from the dagger package - `dagger.#Plan` - we also need to declare it at the top of the pipeline configuration, as well as the bash package - `bash.#Run`:

```cue
import (
  "dagger.io/dagger"
  "universe.dagger.io/bash"
  "universe.dagger.io/docker"
)
```

:::tip
Now that we understand the basics of a Dagger plan, we are ready to learn more about how to interact with the client environment.
This will enable us to configure plans just-in-time, save build artefacts, and perform other interactions with the environment within which Dagger runs.
