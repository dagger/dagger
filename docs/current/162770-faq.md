# FAQ

### What language SDKs are available for Dagger?

We currently offer technical previews of a [Go SDK](/sdk/go) and a [Python SDK](/sdk/python) as well as a [CUE SDK](/sdk/cue). Waiting for your favorite language to be supported? [Let us know which one](https://blocklayer.typeform.com/to/a6m5gKSS), and we'll notify you when it's ready.

### How do I log in to a container registry using a Dagger SDK?

Dagger SDKs use your existing Docker credentials and do not require separate authentication. Simply execute `docker login` against your container registry on the host where your Dagger pipelines are running.

### What API query language does Dagger use?

Dagger uses GraphQL as its low-level language-agnostic API query language.

### Do I need to know GraphQL to use Dagger?

No. You only need to know one of Dagger's supported SDKs languages to use Dagger. The translation to underlying GraphQL  API calls  is handled internally by the Dagger SDK of your choice.

### There's no SDK for &lt;language&gt; yet. Can I still use Dagger?

Yes. It's possible to use the Dagger GraphQL API from any language that [supports GraphQL](https://graphql.org/code/) or from the [Dagger CLI](./cli/698277-index.md).

### I've upgraded to the latest Dagger CLI and my CUE plans no longer work. Why?

The Dagger CLI has changed. The previous CUE-specific version of the Dagger CLI has been renamed to `dagger-cue` and is now part of the [Dagger CUE SDK](./sdk/cue/).
