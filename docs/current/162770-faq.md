# FAQ

### What language SDKs are available for Dagger?

We currently offer technical previews of a [Go SDK](/sdk/go) and a [Python SDK](/sdk/python) as well as a [CUE SDK](/sdk/cue). Waiting for your favorite language to be supported? [Let us know which one](https://blocklayer.typeform.com/to/a6m5gKSS), and we'll notify you when it's ready.

### How do I log in to a container registry using a Dagger SDK?

Dagger SDKs use your existing Docker credentials and do not require separate authentication. Simply execute `docker login` against your container registry on the host where your Dagger pipelines are running.
