# Dagger Documentation

## What is Dagger?

Dagger is a programmable CI/CD engine that runs your pipelines in containers.

### Programmable

Develop your CI/CD pipelines as code, in the same programming language as your application.

### Runs your pipelines in containers

Dagger executes your pipelines entirely as [standard OCI containers](https://opencontainers.org/). This has several benefits:

* **Instant local testing**
* **Portability**: the same pipeline can run on your local machine, a CI runner, a dedicated server, or any container hosting service.
* **Superior caching**: every operation is cached by default, and caching works the same everywhere
* **Compatibility** with the Docker ecosystem: if it runs in a container, you can add it to your pipeline.
* **Cross-language instrumentation**: teams can use each other's tools without learning each other's language.

## Who is it for?

Dagger may be a good fit if you are...

* A developer wishing your CI pipelines were code instead of YAML.
* Your team's "designated devops person", hoping to replace a pile of artisanal scripts with something more powerful.
* A platform engineer writing custom tooling, with the goal of unifying continuous delivery across organizational silos.
* A cloud-native developer advocate or solutions engineer, looking to demonstrate a complex integration on short notice.

## How does it work?

{@include: ../../partials/_how_does_dagger_work.md}

## Getting started

To get started with Dagger, use our [quickstart](./quickstart/648215-quickstart-introduction.mdx), which walks you through the basics of creating and using a pipeline with our SDKs.

Alternatively, choose an SDK and follow that SDK's getting started guide.

## Which SDK should I use?

| If you are... | then you should... |
| -- | -- |
| a Go developer | Use the [Go SDK](sdk/go) |
| a Python developer | Use the [Python SDK](sdk/python) |
| a TypeScript/JavaScript developer | Use the [Node.js SDK](sdk/nodejs) |
| looking for an excuse to learn Go | Use the [Go SDK](sdk/go) |
| looking for an excuse to learn Python | Use the [Python SDK](sdk/python) |
| looking for an excuse to learn TypeScript/JavaScript | Use the [Node.js SDK](sdk/nodejs) |
| waiting for your favorite language to be supported | [Let us know which one](https://airtable.com/shrzABOn1wCk5yBF4), and we'll notify you when it is ready |
| a GraphQL veteran | Use the [GraphQL API](api) |
| a fan of shell scripts | Use the [CLI](cli) |
| a fan of the [CUE](https://cuelang.org) language, and don't mind using the old Dagger engine | Use the [CUE SDK](sdk/cue) |
| Not sure which SDK to choose 🤷 | In doubt, try the [Go SDK](sdk/go). It does not require advanced Go knowledge, and what you learn will transpose well to future SDKs
