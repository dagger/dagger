# Playground

The API Playground is an in-browser tool for testing, running and sharing Dagger GraphQL API queries.

## Features

Some of the things you can do in the API Playground are:

* Write and test Dagger GraphQL API queries.
* Benefit from context-sensitive auto-complete and documentation.
* Craft Dagger pipelines with no required setup.
* Share your work and showcase your Dagger pipelines to others.

## Limitations

* The API Playground operates in a virtualized environment. Data/files written to the host filesystem will not be persisted.
* The API Playground has restricted networking capabilities. For example, it cannot connect to your local host or local computer network.

:::danger
The API Playground is intended for query prototyping and API exploration. It should not be considered production infrastructure. Using/storing secrets, access tokens and other credentials in AP Playground queries is strongly discouraged for security reasons.
