# User and Organization administration

## How users work in Dagger Cloud
User accounts grant a person access to log in to Dagger Cloud to diagnose pipeline failures and collaborate on changes. User information shown on the Runs and Changes pages is populated by the VCS you have integrated with Dagger Cloud. Deleting a Dagger Cloud user will not remove their runs and changes from Dagger Cloud.

## Administering users

:::info
  You must be an admin of the organization to administer users. You cannot change a user's role. Please contact Dagger Support via the in-app messenger for assistance if you need to change a user's role. This functionality is coming soon.
