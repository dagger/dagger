# Quickstart

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

## Set up the example application

The example application used in this tutorial is a simple React application.

Let's begin by cloning the application repository into your local development environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger.git
```

Within the application directory, create a `ci` sub-directory. This sub-directory will hold the code you write in subsequent steps.

```shell
cd hello-dagger && mkdir ci
```
