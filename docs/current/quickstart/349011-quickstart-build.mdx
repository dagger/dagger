## Build the application

If your application passes all its tests, the typical next step is to build it.

So, let's update the previous pipeline and add a build step to it, by running `npm run build`.

:::tip
The `npm run build` command is appropriate for a React application, but other applications are likely to use different commands. Modify your Dagger pipeline accordingly.

<TabItem value="Go">

- It invokes the `Container.WithExec()` method again, this time to define the command `npm run build` in the container.
- It obtains a reference to the `build/` directory in the container with the `Container.Directory()` method. This method returns a `Directory` object.
- It writes the `build/` directory from the container to the host using the `Directory.Export()` method.

Run the pipeline by executing the command below from the application directory:

```shell
go run ci/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Node.js">

This revised pipeline does everything described in the previous step, and then performs the following additional operations:

- It invokes the `Container.withExec()` method again, this time to define the command `npm run build` in the container.
- It obtains a reference to the `build/` directory in the container with the `Container.directory()` method. This method returns a `Directory` object.
- It writes the `build/` directory from the container to the host using the `Directory.export()` method.

Run the pipeline by executing the command below from the application directory:

```shell
node ci/index.mjs
```

This revised pipeline does everything described in the previous step, and then performs the following additional operations:

- It invokes the `Container.with_exec()` method again, this time to define the command `npm run build` in the container.
- It obtains a reference to the `build/` directory in the container with the `Container.directory()` method. This method returns a `Directory` object.
- It writes the `build/` directory from the container to the host using the `Directory.export()` method.

Run the pipeline by executing the command below from the application directory:

```shell
python ci/main.py
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After Dagger resolves the pipeline, the built application is available in a new `build/` sub-directory of the application directory. Confirm this by executing the `tree` command in the application directory, as shown below:

```shell
tree build
