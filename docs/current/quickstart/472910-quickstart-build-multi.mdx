## Perform a multi-stage build

Now that you have a working Dagger pipeline, let's refine and optimize it.

You may have noticed that the previous listing exported the build artifacts to a directory on the host, and then copied them to a directory in the destination container. While this works, a more efficient approach is to use a multi-stage build...something that Dagger, by virtue of its design, excels at.

This is because Dagger SDK objects like `Container` and `Directory` can be thought of as collections of state. You can save this state and reference it elsewhere (even in a different Dagger pipeline or engine). You can also update the state from the point you left off, or use it an input to another operation.

In the context of a multi-stage build, this means that you can use Dagger to:
- Perform a build in a container.
- Obtain and save a `Directory` object referencing the filesystem state of that container (including the build artifacts) after the build.
- Pass the saved `Directory` object as a parameter to a different container or pipeline, thereby transferring the saved filesystem state (and build artifacts) to that container or pipeline.
- Perform further container or pipeline operations as needed.

Let's now update our pipeline to use a multi-stage build, as described above.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

<iframe class="embed" src="https://play.dagger.cloud/embed/ho4ZF-6naKv"></iframe>

Run the pipeline by executing the command below from the application directory:

```shell
go run ci/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Node.js">

<iframe class="embed" src="https://play.dagger.cloud/embed/aPB-msb5UEn"></iframe>

Run the pipeline by executing the command below from the application directory:

```shell
node ci/index.mjs
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

<iframe class="embed" src="https://play.dagger.cloud/embed/tqaPp2aVr_L"></iframe>

Run the pipeline by executing the command below from the application directory:

```shell
python ci/main.py
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This revised pipeline produces the same result as before, but using a two-stage process:

- In the first stage, the pipeline installs dependencies, runs tests and builds the application in the `node:16-slim` container. However, instead of exporting the `build/` directory to the host, it saves the corresponding `Directory` object as a constant. This object represents the filesystem state of the `build/` directory in the container after the build, and is portable to other Dagger pipelines.
- In the second stage, the pipeline uses the saved `Directory` object as input, thereby transferring the filesystem state (the built React application) to the `nginx:alpine` container. It then publishes the result to a registry as previously described.
