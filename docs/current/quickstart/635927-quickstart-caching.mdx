## Use caching

One of Dagger's most powerful features is its ability to cache data across pipeline runs. Dagger lets you define one or more directories as cache volume and persists their contents across runs. This enables you to reuse the contents of the cache every time the pipeline runs, and thereby speed up pipeline operations.

You may have noticed that the example pipeline executes the `npm install` command to download the application's dependencies every time the pipeline runs. Since these dependencies are usually locked to specific versions in the application's manifest, re-downloading them on every pipeline run is inefficient and time-consuming.

This step is, therefore, a good candidate for a cache. Let's update the pipeline accordingly.

:::tip
The `npm install` command is appropriate for a React application, but other applications are likely to use different commands. Modify your Dagger pipeline accordingly.

This revised pipeline now uses a cache for the application dependencies.

- It uses the client's `CacheVolume()` method to initialize a new cache volume.
- It uses the `Container.WithMountedCache()` method to mount this cache volume at the `node_modules/` mount point in the container.
- It uses the `Container.WithExec()` method to define the `npm install` command. When executed, this command downloads and installs dependencies in the `node_modules/` directory. Since this directory is defined as a cache volume, its contents will persist even after the pipeline terminates and can be reused on the next pipeline run.

Run the pipeline by executing the command below from the application directory:

```shell
go run ci/main.go
```

This revised pipeline produces the same result as before.

Run the pipeline a few times. Notice that on the first run, the application dependencies are downloaded as usual. However, since the dependencies are cached, subsequent pipeline runs will skip the download operation and be significantly faster (assuming that there are no other changes to the application code).
