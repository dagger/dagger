## Run application tests

The pipeline in the previous example was illustrative - you wouldn't ever use it in the real world! So let's write a Dagger pipeline to do something more useful, like running an application's tests.

The code listing below demonstrates a Dagger pipeline that runs tests for the example application, by executing the `npm run test` command.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

```go file=snippets/test/main.go
```

This code listing does the following:

- It creates a Dagger client with `Connect()` as before.
- It uses the client's `Container().From()` method to initialize a new container from a base image - again, the `node:16-slim` image. This base image is the Node.js version to use for testing. The `From()` method returns a new `Container` object with the result.
- It uses the `Container.WithMountedDirectory()` method to mount the source code directory on the host at the `/src` mount point in the container, and the `Container.WithWorkdir()` method to set the working directory to that mount point.
  - Notice that the `Container.WithMountedDirectory()` accepts additional options to exclude (or include) specific files from the mount. In this case, it excludes the `node_modules` (locally-installed dependencies) and `ci` (pipeline code) directories.
- It uses the `Container.WithExec()` method to define the commands to install dependencies and run tests in the container - in this case, the commands `npm install` and `npm test -- --watchAll=false`.
- It uses the `Container.ExitCode()` method to execute the command and obtain the corresponding exit code. An exit code of `0` implies successful execution (all tests pass).
  - Failure, indicated by a non-zero exit code, will cause the pipeline to terminate.

:::tip
The `from()`, `withMountedDirectory()`, `withWorkdir()` and `withExec()` methods all return a `Container`, making it easy to chain method calls together and create a pipeline that is intuitive to understand.
