# Installation

:::note
The Dagger Python SDK requires [Python 3.10 or later](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html). Using a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) is recommended.
:::

Install the Dagger Python SDK in your project's virtual environment using `pip`:

```shell
pip install dagger-io
```

You can also install via [Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dagger-io), from the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html#how-can-i-install-packages-from-conda-forge) channel:

```shell
conda install dagger-io
```
