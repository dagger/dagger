# Adopting Dagger

You’ve done the [quickstart](quickstart/index.mdx), and now you’re probably asking yourself, "What should I do next?" 

We get it, looking at that many lines of YAML can be intimidating. 
Since each pipeline is unique in tooling and functionally, our general answer to is usually "start simple". Pick a part of your pipeline to Daggerize first, and then continue to daggerize from there. 

Not sure which part of your pipeline to Daggerize first? Reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dagger-io) via our [help forum](https://discord.com/channels/707636530424053791/1030538312508776540). Our team and your fellow Daggernauts will be happy to provide more specific guidance on your use case there! 

Want to see how others have used Dagger? Check out our [case studies](https://dagger.io/resources/Case-Studies) or watch [demos](https://dagger.io/resources/Videos) from community members like yourself. 

Do you have a use case that you’d like to talk about privately? Reach out to us at solutions@dagger.io
