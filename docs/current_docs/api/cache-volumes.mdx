# Cache Volumes

Cache volumes are especially useful when dealing with package managers such as `npm`, `maven`, `pip` and similar. Since these dependencies are usually locked to specific versions in the application's manifest, re-downloading them on every session is inefficient and time-consuming.

For these tools to cache properly, they need their own cache data (usually a directory) to be persisted between sessions. By using a cache volume for this data, Dagger can reuse the cached contents across pipeline runs and reduce execution time.

Cache volumes must be explicitly defined and used in your Dagger Function. Here is an example:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

```go file=../cookbook/snippets/cache-dependencies/go/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

```python file=../cookbook/snippets/cache-dependencies/python/main.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript file=../cookbook/snippets/cache-dependencies/typescript/index.ts
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
