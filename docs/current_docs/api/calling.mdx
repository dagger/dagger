# Calling the API

You can call the Dagger API from code using a custom Dagger function created with a type-safe Dagger SDK, or from the command line using the Dagger CLI.

The different ways to call the Dagger API are:

- From the Dagger CLI
  - [`dagger core`](./clients-cli.mdx#dagger-api) for core functions
  - [`dagger call`](./clients-cli.mdx#dagger-functions) for [custom functions](./custom-functions.mdx)
- From a custom application created with a Dagger SDK
  - [`dagger run`](./clients-sdk.mdx#custom-applications)
- From a [language-native GraphQL client](./clients-http.mdx#language-native-http-clients)
- From a command-line HTTP or GraphQL client
  - [`curl`](./clients-http.mdx#command-line-http-clients)
  - [`dagger query`](./clients-http.mdx#dagger-cli)

:::note
The Dagger CLI can call any Dagger function, either from your local filesystem or from a remote Git repository. The Dagger CLI can be used interactively, from a shell script, or from a CI configuration. Apart from the Dagger CLI, no other infrastructure or tooling is required to call Dagger functions.
