# Calling the API

You can call the Dagger API using a Dagger SDK in one of the supported programming languages, using the Dagger CLI, or using raw queries via your programming language's native GraphQL client. Typically, you would do this from a custom client tool or from your application test suite using the `dagger run ...`, `dagger core ...`, or `dagger query ...` commands.

Using Dagger SDKs or raw HTTP queries is only recommended if you already have existing tools that you specifically can't (or don't wish to) modify, or for niche use cases. For all other scenarios, the recommended approach is to use the [Dagger CLI](./clients-cli.mdx) or [Dagger Functions](./extending.mdx).
