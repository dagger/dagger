# Dagger CLI

The Dagger CLI offers a `dagger query` sub-command, which provides an easy way to call the Dagger API from the command line.

This example demonstrates how to build a Go application by cloning the [canonical Git repository for Go](https://go.googlesource.com/example/+/HEAD/hello) and building the "Hello, world" example program from it by calling the Dagger API via `dagger query`.

Create a new shell script named `build.sh` and add the following code to it:

```shell file=./snippets/clients-cli/build.sh
```

This script uses `dagger query` to send two GraphQL queries to the Dagger API. The first query returns a content-addressed identifier of the source code directory from the remote Git repository. This is interpolated into the second query, which initializes a new container, mounts the source code directory, compiles the source code, and writes the compiled binary back to the host filesystem.

Add the executable bit to the shell script and then run it by executing the commands below:

```shell
chmod +x ./build.sh
dagger run ./build.sh
```

The `dagger run` command executes the script in a Dagger session and displays live progress. On completion, the built Go application will be available in the working directory on the host, as shown below:

```shell
tree
.
├── build.sh
└── dagger-builds-hello
```
