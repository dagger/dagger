# Dagger CLI

The Dagger CLI lets you call the Dagger API directly from the command-line via the `dagger core ...` command, without needing to first load a Dagger module. This is useful in some scenarios:

- You want to use Dagger for simple pipelines that are fully satisfied by the core Dagger API.

    ```shell
    dagger core container from --address="cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base" \
      with-exec --args="apk","add","go" \
      with-directory --path="/src" --directory="https://github.com/golang/example#master" \
      with-workdir --path="/src/hello" \
      with-exec --args="go","build","-o","hello","." \
      file --path="./hello" \
      export --path="./hello-from-dagger"
    ```

- You want to experiment with Dagger without having to program a Dagger module.

    ```shell
    dagger core container from --address=alpine file --path=/etc/os-release contents
    ```

- You are looking for a nice alternative to `docker run`.

    ```shell
    dagger core container from --address=cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base terminal
    ```
