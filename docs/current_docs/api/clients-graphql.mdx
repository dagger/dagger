# GraphQL Clients

It's possible to call the Dagger API from [any language that supports GraphQL](https://graphql.org/code/). GraphQL has a large and growing list of client implementations in over 20 languages.

This examples demonstrates how to connect to the Dagger API and run a simple pipeline in the following languages:

- Rust, using the [gql_client library](https://github.com/arthurkhlghatyan/gql-client-rs) (MIT License)
- PHP, using the [php-graphql-client library](https://github.com/mghoneimy/php-graphql-client) (MIT License)

Once the client library is installed, create an API client as described below.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Rust">

Add the following code to `src/main.rs`:

```rust file=./snippets/clients-graphql/main.rs
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="PHP">

Create a new file named `client.php` and add the following code to it:

```php file=./snippets/clients-graphql/client.php
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This code listing initializes the client library and defines the Dagger pipeline to be executed as a GraphQL query.
