# Custom Types

A Dagger module can have multiple object types defined. It's important to understand that they are only accessible through [chaining](./index.mdx#chaining), starting from a function in the main object.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

Here is an example of a `github` Dagger module, with a function named `DaggerOrganization`
that returns a custom `Organization` type, itself containing a collection of
`Account` types:

```go file=./snippets/custom-types/go/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

Here is an example of a `github` Dagger module, with a function named `dagger_organization`
that returns a custom `Organization` type, itself containing a collection of
`Account` types:

```python file=./snippets/custom-types/python/main.py
```

The [`dagger.field`](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#dagger.field) descriptors expose getter functions without arguments, for their [attributes](./state.mdx).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

Here is an example of a `github` Dagger module, with a function named `daggerOrganization`
that returns a custom `Organization` type, itself containing a collection of
`Account` types:

```typescript file=./snippets/custom-types/typescript/index.ts
```

TypeScript has multiple ways to support complex data types. However, the Dagger TypeScript SDK only supports it through fields (decorated with `@func()`) inside classes because `type` and `interface` keywords do not allows decorators.

:::note
When the Dagger Engine extends the Dagger API schema with these types, it prefixes
their names with the name of the main object:
- Github
- GithubAccount
- GithubOrganization

This is to prevent possible naming conflicts when loading multiple modules,
which is reflected in code generation (for example, when using this module in
another one as a dependency).
:::

Here's an example of calling a Dagger Function from this module to get all member URLs:

```shell
dagger call dagger-organization members url
```

The result will be:

```
https://github.com/jane
https://github.com/john
```
