# Alternative Package Managers

:::important
This page is only applicable to the TypeScript SDK. Alternative package managers are not currently supported in the Python and Go SDKs.
:::

TypeScript can manage dependencies using multiple package managers. The [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime supports [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/), [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) &amp; [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/). The [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime supports `bun`.

By default, the TypeScript SDK executes functions using the Node.js runtime with [yarn v1.22.22](https://yarnpkg.com/), but you can configure an alternative package manager or version in your Dagger module's `package.json` file by setting the `packageManager` property.

## Npm

Set the value to `npm` to use the Npm package manager. You can also set a specific version with a suffix, e.g.:

```json
  "packageManager": "npm@10.8.2"
```

If no version is specified, `npm@10.7.0` is used by default.

## Yarn

Set the value to `yarn` to use the Yarn package manager. You can also set a specific version with a suffix, e.g.:

```json
  "packageManager": "yarn@1.22.21"
```

If no version is specified, `yarn@1.22.22` is used by default.

If you use Yarn 3.0 or above, the TypeScript SDK will also generate a `.yarnrc.yml` file in your module's root directory. This file is used to configure the Yarn package manager linker to `node_modules`.

This is required to correctly resolve `@dagger.io/dagger` as local dependencie of your module.

```yaml
nodeLinker: node-modules
```

## Pnpm

Set the value to `pnpm` to use the Pnpm package manager. You can also set a specific version with a suffix, e.g.:

```json
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.9"
```

If no version is specified, `pnpm@8.15.4` is used.

The TypeScript SDK will also generate a `pnpm-workspace.yml` file in your module's root directory. This file is used to configure the Pnpm package manager.

This is required to correctly resolve `@dagger.io/dagger` as local dependencie of your module.

```yaml
packages:
  - './sdk'
```

## Bun

:::warning
Bun runtime support is still experimental. Unexpected results may occur in some cases.
:::

Setting the `runtime` property to `bun` will use the Bun runtime and its package manager. You do not need to set `packageManager` field explicitly, e.g.:

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "bun"
  }
```

## Automatic Detection

When a package manager is not explicitly defined within the `package.json` file, Dagger automatically identifies the appropriate package manager by examining the project's lock files inside the project's `.dagger` directory.

- If Dagger finds any of the following lock files : `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`, it automatically selects the corresponding package manager with a predefined default version: `npm@10.7.0`, `yarn@1.22.22` or `pnpm@8.15.4`.
- If none of the above mentioned lock files are present, and `bun.lockb` file is present, Dagger will choose `bun` as the runtime and package manager with a predefined default version: `bun@1.0.11`.
- `yarn@1.22.22` is the last default, when nothing mentioned above applies.

:::warning
This behavior however should be considered a sensible fallback, and not as an explicit configuration. Since this default can change, we encourage you to configure a package manager explicitly.
