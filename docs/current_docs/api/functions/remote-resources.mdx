# Remote Resources

Dagger Functions can be passed remote resources, such as OCI container images from remote registries or remote Git repositories, as arguments. Dagger will automatically convert the remote resource into the corresponding core type when passing it to a Dagger Function.

## Remote container images

Dagger Functions that accept container arguments can be passed the address(es) of one or more OCI images. The Dagger CLI will dynamically pull the image, and pass the resulting `Container` object as argument to the Dagger Function.

Here is an example of passing a container image reference to a Dagger Function as an argument. The Dagger Function scans the container using Trivy and reports any vulnerabilities found.

```shell
dagger -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy@v0.3.0 call scan-container --ctr=index.docker.io/alpine:latest
```

## Remote Git repositories

Dagger Functions that accept directory arguments can be supplied with local filesystem paths or remote Git repository references. In both cases, the Dagger CLI will convert the argument to a `Directory` object referencing the contents of that filesystem path or Git repository location, and pass it to the Dagger Function.

Here is an example of a Go builder Dagger Function that accepts a remote Git address (the address of Dagger's open-source repository) as a `Directory` argument, builds a binary version of the Dagger CLI and exports the build directory to the host filesystem as `./build`:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.2.0 call build --source=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger export --path=./build
```
