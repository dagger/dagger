# Dagger API

One of Dagger's key aspects is cross-language instrumentation: teams can leverage their familiar languages without the need to learn a new DSL to write their Dagger Functions. Dagger allows this by exposing its functionality through a GraphQL API, which serves as a low-level language-agnostic API framework for all Dagger operations.

This approach has multiple benefits:

- It enables Dagger Function developers to use whichever language feels natural and intuitive to them, without having to think about interoperability.
- Even though Dagger Functions may be written in different languages, they are all run by the same Dagger Engine. So common concerns like logging, scaling, monitoring and others only need to be solved once, and can then be applied for everyone.
- Using GraphQL as a common low-level language facilitates interoperability. Each Dagger SDK generates native code-bindings for all dependencies from the GraphQL API. This gives you all the benefits of type-checking, code completion and other IDE features for your favorite language when developing Dagger Functions.

In practice, interacting with the API directly is optional. You can instead use Dagger Functions, a Dagger SDK, or the Dagger CLI.
