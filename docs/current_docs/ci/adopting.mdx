# Adopting Dagger

After [completing the quickstart](/quickstart/ci) and learning the basic concepts, it's time to adopt Dagger in your project. Here's a framework to help you successfully "daggerize" your pipelines:

:::important
Start small and build incrementally. Check out these [livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyHqb4A5ee1sOx00YIQzOEYEe747tMO_b) to see how others have successfully implemented Dagger.
:::

## 1. Research & Preparation

- Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dagger-io) to get help and inspiration from the community
- Review [case studies](https://dagger.io/resources/Case-Studies) and [demo videos](https://dagger.io/resources/Videos) from successful adopters
- Consider if Dagger is a good fit for your project (may not be ideal for Windows/Mac-only applications or projects already using monolithic toolchains like Gradle/Nix/Bazel)
- For specific use cases, reach out to solutions@dagger.io

## 2. Create a Proof of Concept

Start with a small, focused proof-of-concept to demonstrate value quickly:

### Choose the Right Pipeline
- Select a pipeline with clear pain points (can't run across environments, brittle integrations, slow performance)
- Ensure it can be daggerized within a week
- Pick something you have authority to modify

### Select a Language
- Choose a language your team is comfortable with
- Consider the [official SDKs](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/main/sdk) (Python, Go, TypeScript) or [community SDKs](https://dagger.io/community-sdks)
- For polyglot teams, leverage Dagger's cross-language linking capabilities

### Implementation Resources
- Follow the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart/ci) for basic implementation steps
- Consult the [Dagger API reference](https://docs.dagger.io/api/reference) for advanced features
- Explore [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev) for reusable components

## 3. Integration

### Development Environment
- Use the `dagger` CLI directly when possible (document commands in README)
- Wrap `dagger call` in existing tools like `make` if preferred
- Consider embedding Dagger as a library only as a last resort

### CI Integration
- Follow the [integration guides](/ci/integrations/ci) for your platform
- Run daggerized and existing pipelines in parallel during transition
- Simplify CI configuration by replacing complex YAML/scripts with `dagger call`
- For distributed workloads, split into multiple `dagger call` pipelines
- Set up persistent caching for optimal performance

### Demonstrate Success
- Show your team what you've accomplished
- Consider presenting at Dagger community calls

## 4. Expand Your Adoption

### Expansion Strategies
- **Incremental**: The safest approach - gradually daggerize one pipeline at a time
- **All-in**: Consider during major platform migrations - replace proprietary configurations with Dagger all at once

### Create Reusable Modules
- Start with all functions in one module for speed
- Gradually extract reusable components into separate modules
- For large organizations, create centralized module repositories that can be shared across teams
- Consider [publishing reusable modules](https://docs.dagger.io/api/daggerverse) to the Daggerverse

### Explore Advanced Use Cases
- Consider [using Dagger's LLM support](/features/llm) to build AI agents that enhance your CI/CD processes

Happy daggerizing!
