# Podman

Dagger can be used with any OCI-compatible container runtime, including Podman.

## How it works

By default, Dagger tries to invoke the `docker` executable. Since Podman is CLI-compatible with Docker, it can be used as a drop-in replacement. This is as simple as creating a symbolic link to the Podman executable in your system path and naming it `docker`.

## Prerequisites

- Podman installed and running on the host system.
- Podman machine configured for [rootful container execution](https://docs.podman.io/en/stable/markdown/podman-machine-set.1.html#rootful).

## Example

To use Podman with Dagger, create a symbolic link as below:

```shell
sudo ln -s $(which podman) /usr/local/bin/docker
```

:::note
Podman Desktop on Mac and RHEL 8.x users may need to additionally execute `modprobe iptable_nat`.

To access the virtual machine used by Podman Desktop on Mac, use the commands below:

```shell
# list podman machines
podman machine list 

# log in to machine
podman machine ssh podman-machine-default

# execute command
sudo modprobe iptable_nat
```
