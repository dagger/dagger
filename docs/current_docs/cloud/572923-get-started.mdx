# Get Started with Dagger Cloud

## Introduction

Dagger Cloud provides pipeline visualization, operational insights, and distributed caching for your Daggerized pipelines.

This guide helps you get started with Dagger Cloud. Here are the steps you'll follow:

- [Sign up for Dagger Cloud](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud)
- [Send telemetry to Dagger Cloud](#step-2-send-telemetry-to-dagger-cloud)
- [Visualize pipeline runs with Dagger Cloud](#step-3-visualize-your-pipeline-runs-with-dagger-cloud)
- [Synchronize cache volumes with the Dagger Cloud experimental distributed cache (available on the Team plan)](#step-4-use-cache-volumes-with-the-experimental-dagger-cloud-cache)

:::note Dagger Cloud plans
Dagger Cloud includes plans for both individuals and teams. [See more information about the plans](https://www.dagger.io/pricing). 
:::

## Prerequisites

- You have an understanding of how Dagger works. If not, [read the Dagger Quickstart](../quickstart/index.mdx).
- You have a GitHub account (required for Dagger Cloud identity verification). If not, [register for a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
- You have a source code repository and a Dagger pipeline that interacts with it. If not, follow the steps in Appendix A to [create and populate a GitHub repository with a sample application and Dagger pipeline](#appendix-a-create-a-dagger-pipeline).

## Step 1: Sign up for Dagger Cloud

:::info
At the end of this step, you will have signed up for Dagger Cloud and obtained a Dagger Cloud token. If you already have a Dagger Cloud account and token, you may skip this step.
:::

Follow the steps below to sign up for Dagger Cloud, create an organization and obtain a Dagger Cloud token.

1. Sign up for Dagger Cloud by selecting a plan on the [Dagger website](https://www.dagger.io/pricing). Click **Continue with GitHub** to log in with your GitHub account.

1. After authorizing Dagger Cloud for your GitHub account, you'll create your organization.

    :::info Naming your organization
    Organization names may contain alphanumeric characters and dashes and are unique across Dagger Cloud. We recommend using your company name or team name for your organization.
    :::

1. Review and select a Dagger Cloud subscription plan.

1. If you selected the **Team** plan:

    1. You will be presented with the option to add teammates to your Dagger Cloud account. This step is optional and not available in the Individual plan.
    
    1. You will then enter your payment information. After your free 14 day trial completes, you will be automatically subscribed to the Dagger Cloud Team plan.

1. Click **Go to dashboard**. The next step walks you through how to send telemetry to Dagger Cloud.

## Step 2: Send telemetry to Dagger Cloud

:::info
At the end of this step, you will have connected Dagger Cloud with your CI provider or CI tool using your Dagger Cloud token. If you have already connected Dagger Cloud with your CI provider/tool and don't see data yet in your dashboard, skip to the next step.
:::

You can use Dagger Cloud with your CI and for your local development workflows. You instruct your Dagger Engine to connect to Dagger Cloud by referencing your unique Dagger Cloud token. Dagger Cloud creates this token automatically when you sign up.

To find your token, browse to the **Organization Settings** page, by clicking your profile photo in the left sidebar and then clicking Organization Settings. Select the **Configuration** tab. You can also use this URL pattern: `https://dagger.cloud/{Your Org Name}/settings?tab=configuration`

    ![Get token](/img/current_docs/cloud/get-started/get-token.png)

  :::warning
  If you regenerate your token, you must replace the token wherever you've referenced it. To reduce operational interruptions, only regenerate your token if it has been leaked. 
  :::

Once you have your token, you can now use it to send telemetry from your CI and development machines.

### Local development
You can visualize and debug your local Dagger pipeline runs with Dagger Cloud to identify issues before pushing them to CI.

To configure local development, set your Dagger Cloud token as an environment variable. For example: `export DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN={your token}`

:::info BEST PRACTICES FOR VISUALIZING LOCAL RUNS IN DAGGER CLOUD
Dagger Cloud uses metadata from your version control system (VCS), such as git, to populate some information in the user interface. Therefore, you should run your Dagger pipelines within a VCS context, such as a local directory linked to a cloned git repository.
:::


### In CI
The general procedure to connect Dagger Cloud with a CI provider/CI tool is:

- Add your Dagger Cloud token to your CI workflows.
  - Store the Dagger Cloud token as a secret with your CI.
    :::danger Keep your Dagger Cloud token private
    You must store the Dagger Cloud token as a secret (not plaintext) with your CI provider and reference it in your CIâ€™s workflow. Using a secret is recommended to protect your Dagger Cloud account from being used by forks of your project. We provide links in the steps below for configuring secrets with popular CI tools.
    :::
  - Add the secret to your CI environment as a variable named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`.
- For **Team** plan subscribers with ephemeral CI runners only: Add a wait step (example below) for the Docker configuration to allow the Dagger Engine to push cache volumes to the experimental Dagger Cloud distributed cache. Subscribers on the **Individual** plan do not have access to the experimental distributed cache and do not need to add this step.
- If you are using GitHub Actions, install the Dagger Cloud GitHub app for GitHub Checks. This app adds a GitHub Check to your pull requests and links to the run status and pipeline visualization for the commit in Dagger Cloud.

You can use Dagger Cloud whether you're hosting your own CI runners and infrastructure or using hosted/SaaS runners.

:::danger
When using self-hosted CI runners on AWS infrastructure, NAT Gateways are a common source of unexpected network charges. It's advisable to setup an Amazon S3 Gateway for these cases. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) for detailed information on how to do this.

<Tabs groupId="ci">
<TabItem value="GitHub Actions">

1. Create a new secret for your GitHub repository named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`, and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Refer to the GitHub documentation [on creating repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

1. Update your GitHub Actions workflow and add the secret to your `dagger run` step as an environment variable. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and can be referenced in the workflow using the format `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN }}`. Refer to the GitHub documentation on [using secrets in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#using-secrets-in-a-workflow).

1. For **Team** plan subscribers with ephemeral CI runners only: Update your GitHub Actions workflow (example below) and adjust the `docker stop` timeout period so that Docker waits longer before killing the Dagger Engine container, to give it more time to push data to the Dagger Cloud cache. Refer to the Docker documentation on the [`docker stop` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/).

1. Install the [Dagger Cloud GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/dagger-cloud). Once installed, GitHub automatically adds a new check for your GitHub pull requests, with a link to see CI status for each workflow run in Dagger Cloud.

Here is a sample GitHub Actions workflow file with the Dagger Cloud integration highlighted:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/dagger.yml" file=./snippets/get-started/ci/actions.yml
```

:::tip
You can use this file with the starter application and Dagger pipeline in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-create-a-dagger-pipeline) to test your Dagger Cloud/GitHub Actions integration.

1. For **Team** plan subscribers with ephemeral CI runners only: Update your GitLab CI workflow (example below) and adjust the `docker stop` timeout period so that Docker waits longer before killing the Dagger Engine container, to give it more time to push data to the Dagger Cloud cache. Refer to the Docker documentation on the [`docker stop` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/).

Here is a sample GitLab CI workflow with the Dagger Cloud integration highlighted:

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml" file=./snippets/get-started/ci/gitlab.yml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CircleCI">

1. Create a new environment variable in your CircleCI project named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Refer to the CircleCI documentation on [creating environment variables for a project](https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).

1. For **Team** plan subscribers with ephemeral CI runners only: Update your CircleCI workflow (example below) and adjust the `docker stop` timeout period so that Docker waits longer before killing the Dagger Engine container, to give it more time to push data to the Dagger Cloud cache. Refer to the Docker documentation on the [`docker stop` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/).

1. For GitHub, GitLab or Atlassian Bitbucket source code repositories only: Update your CircleCI workflow and add the following pipeline values to the CI environment. Refer to the CircleCI documentation on [using pipeline values](https://circleci.com/docs/variables/#pipeline-values).

    GitHub:

    ```yaml
    environment:

    ```

    GitLab:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_NUMBER: << pipeline.number >>
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_TRIGGER_LOGIN: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.user_username >>
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_REPO_URL: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.repo_url >>
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_REPO_FULL_NAME: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.repo_name >>
    ```

    Atlassian BitBucket:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_NUMBER: << pipeline.number >>
    ```

Here is a sample CircleCI workflow. The `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable will be automatically injected.

```yaml title=".circleci/config.yml" file=./snippets/get-started/ci/circle.yml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Jenkins">

1. Configure a Jenkins credential named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Refer to the Jenkins documentation on [creating credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/#configuring-credentials) and [credential security](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/#credential-security).

1. Update your Jenkins Pipeline and add the variable to the CI environment. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and can be referenced in the Pipeline environment using the format `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN = credentials('DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN')`. Refer to the Jenkins documentation on [handling credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#handling-credentials).

Here is a sample Jenkins Pipeline with the Dagger Cloud integration highlighted:

```groovy title="Jenkinsfile" file=./snippets/get-started/ci/Jenkinsfile
```

:::note
- This Jenkins Pipeline assumes that the the Dagger CLI is pre-installed on the Jenkins runner(s), together with other required dependencies.
- If you use the same Jenkins server for more than one Dagger Cloud organization, create distinct credentials for each organization and link them to their respective Dagger Cloud tokens.
- Typically, Jenkins servers are non-ephemeral and therefore it is not necessary to adjust the `docker stop` timeout.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Argo Workflows">

1. Create a new Kubernetes secret named `dagger-cloud` and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). An example command to achieve this is shown below (replace the `TOKEN` placeholder with your actual token value). Refer to the Kubernetes documentation [on creating secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic dagger-cloud --from-literal=token=TOKEN
    ```

1. Update your Argo Workflows specification and add the secret as an environment variable. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`.

Here is a sample Argo Workflows specification with Dagger Cloud integration:

```yaml title="workflow.yaml" file=../guides/snippets/argo-workflows/workflow.yaml
```

## Step 3: Visualize your pipeline runs with Dagger Cloud

:::info
At the end of this step, you will have data from one or more CI or local runs available for inspection and debugging in Dagger Cloud.
:::

### Local development
:::info Best practices for visualizing local runs in Dagger Cloud
Dagger Cloud uses metadata from your version control system (VCS), such as git, to populate some information in the user interface. Therefore, you should run your Dagger pipelines within a VCS context, such as a local directory linked to a cloned git repository.
:::

Before completing these steps, ensure you've [added your Dagger Cloud token as an environment variable](#local-development). 

1. In your terminal, run your Dagger pipeline. If your environment variable is properly defined, you will see a Dagger Cloud URL printed in the terminal. 
1. Click on the URL to view your pipeline run in Dagger Cloud.

Here's an example running a Dagger NodeJS pipeline named index.mjs locally after committing a change with git.

```shell
  git commit -s -m "Updated quickstart link in README"
  dagger run node index.mjs
  ```

Because we ran this in a git context, the Dagger Cloud UI shows the VCS git metadata associated with the commit. 

![Local run with metadata](/img/current_docs/cloud/get-started/local-run-git-metadata.png)

If you run outside of a git context, Dagger Cloud will show the same detailed steps. However, the top-level metadata will not be populated. 

![Local run, no metadata](/img/current_docs/cloud/get-started/local-run-no-metadata.png)

:::info Multiple Dagger Cloud organizations
To use Dagger Cloud locally with multiple organizations, you must set distinct environment variables for each organizationâ€™s Dagger Cloud token. You can find the unique token for an organization in the **Organization Settings** page.
:::

### In CI
Once your CI provider/tool is connected with Dagger Cloud, itâ€™s time to test the integration.

To do this, trigger your CI workflow and Dagger pipeline by pushing a commit or opening a pull request. If you are using the starter application and pipeline from Appendix A, use the following commands:

```shell
sed -i 's/Welcome to Dagger/Welcome to Dagger Cloud/g' src/App.tsx
git commit -a -m "Updated welcome message"
git push
```

Once your CI workflow begins, navigate to the **All Runs** page of the Dagger Cloud dashboard. You should see your most recent CI run as the first entry in the table, as shown below:

![View runs](/img/current_docs/cloud/get-started/view-runs.png)

A run represents one invocation of a Dagger pipeline. It contains detailed information about the steps performed by the pipeline.

The **All Runs** page provides an overview of all runs. You can drill down into the details of a specific run by clicking it. This directs you to a run-specific Run Details page, as shown below:

![View run details](/img/current_docs/cloud/get-started/view-run-details-tree.png)

The **Run Details** page includes detailed status and duration metadata about the pipeline steps. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and steps within those pipelines. If there are any errors in the run, Dagger Cloud automatically brings you to the first error in the list. You see detailed logs and output of each step, making it easy for you to debug your pipelines and collaborate with your teammates.

Learn more about the [Dagger Cloud user interface](./reference/741031-user-interface.mdx).

## Step 4: Use cache volumes with the experimental Dagger Cloud cache

:::info
At the end of this step, you will have integrated Dagger Cloud's experimental distributed cache with your workflows.
:::

:::info
Dagger Cloud's distributed caching feature is only available under the **Team** plan.
:::

One of Dagger's most powerful features is its ability to [cache data across pipeline runs](../quickstart/635927-caching.mdx). This is especially useful when dealing with package managers such as `npm`, `maven`, `pip` and similar. For these tools to cache properly, they need their own cache data (usually a directory) to be persisted between runs. Since these dependencies are usually locked to specific versions in the application's manifest, re-downloading them on every pipeline run is inefficient and time-consuming.

Dagger comes with built-in support to define one or more such directories as cache volumes and persist their contents across runs. Dagger Cloud enhances caching support significantly and allows cross-host synchronization of cache volumes. This allows multiple machines, including ephemeral runners, to intelligently share a distributed cache.

Dagger Cloud automatically detects and creates cache volumes when they are declared in your code. To see how this works, add a cache volume to your Dagger pipeline and then trigger a run. If you're using the starter application and Dagger pipeline from [Appendix A](#appendix-a-create-a-dagger-pipeline), do this by updating the Dagger pipeline code as shown below (changes are highlighted):

```javascript file=./snippets/get-started/step4/index.mjs
```

This revised pipeline now uses a cache volume for the application dependencies.

- It uses the client's `cacheVolume()` method to initialize a new cache volume named `node`.
- It uses the `Container.withMountedCache()` method to mount this cache volume at the node_modules/ mount point in the container.

Next, trigger your CI workflow by pushing a commit or opening a pull request.

:::info
If you've configured cache volumes for the first time in a local development environment, run your pipeline via the Dagger CLI and then run the command `docker container stop -t 300 "$(docker container list --filter 'name=^dagger-engine-*' -q)"`. This step ensures your new cache volumes populate to Dagger Cloud as these are during the engine shutdown phase. You only need to do this the first time you use Dagger Cloud locally with cache volumes or when you add new cache volumes in your Dagger pipeline.
:::

To see your cache volumes, browse to the **Organization Settings** page of Dagger Cloud dashboard (accessible by clicking your user profile icon in the Dagger Cloud interface) and navigate to the **Configuration** tab. You should see the newly-created volume listed and enabled.

:::note
Your cache volumes will appear in the UI within a few minutes after your pipeline run has completed. If you don't see them in the UI, ensure you've referenced the volumes in your Dagger code and that you've set up your CI or local development workflows to push the cache volumes to Dagger Cloud.
:::

![Manage volumes](/img/current_docs/cloud/get-started/manage-volumes.png)

You can create as many volumes as needed and manage them from the **Configuration** tab of your Dagger Cloud organization page.

## Conclusion

This guide introduced you to Dagger Cloud and walked you registering a new organization, integrating Dagger Cloud with your CI provider/tool, and using Dagger Cloudâ€™s visualization and caching features. For more information and technical support, visit the [Dagger Cloud reference pages](./reference/index.mdx) or contact Dagger via the support messenger in Dagger Cloud.

## Appendix A: Create a Dagger pipeline

Before you can integrate Dagger Cloud into your CI process, you need a Dagger pipeline and source code for it to interact with.

If you don't have these already, follow the steps below to create an application and its accompanying Dagger pipeline.

:::note
This section assumes that you have a Node.js development environment. It uses the starter React application and Dagger pipeline from the [Dagger Quickstart](../quickstart/index.mdx) in tandem with a GitHub repository. If you wish to use a different application or a different VCS, adapt the steps below accordingly.
:::

1. Begin by cloning the example application's repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger.git
    ```

1. Install the Dagger Node.js SDK:

    ```shell
    cd hello-dagger
    npm install @dagger.io/dagger --save-dev
    ```

1. In the application directory, create a file named `index.mjs` and add the following code to it.

    ```javascript file=./snippets/get-started/appa/index.mjs
    ```

    This Dagger pipeline uses the Dagger Node.js SDK to test, build and publish a containerized version of the application to a public registry.

    :::info
    Explaining the details of how this pipeline works is outside the scope of this guide; however, you can find a detailed explanation and equivalent pipeline code for Go and Python in the [Dagger Quickstart](../quickstart/730264-publish.mdx).
    :::

1. Commit the changes:

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -a -m "Added Dagger pipeline"
    ```

1. Create a private repository in your GitHub account and push the changes to it:

    ```shell
    git remote remove origin
    gh auth login
    gh repo create hello-dagger --push --source . --private
    ```
