# Components

Dagger consists of a number of components, all of which work together in an integrated fashion to provide a framework to build and run composable workflows.

## Typed Objects

Objects are the basic building blocks - such as containers, directories, files, and LLMs - that hold data (state) and offer operations (methods) you can link together. Each operation on an object runs inside a container, ensuring consistent, isolated execution.

## Functions

Dagger Functions are individual units of computation that perform a specific task by combining operations on typed objects with custom logic. Dagger Functions are written in a programming language using a type-safe Dagger SDK, and packaged and shared in Dagger modules.

## Modules

Dagger Functions are packaged, shared and reused using Dagger modules.

When a Dagger module is loaded into a Dagger session, the Dagger API is dynamically extended with new functions served by that module. So, after loading a Dagger module, an API client can now call all of the original core functions plus the new functions provided by that module.

## CLI

The Dagger CLI is your primary entrypoint to Dagger. It is a full-featured, easy to use tool that can be used interactively from a terminal or non-interactively from a shell script or a CI runner. The Dagger CLI also includes a real-time visualization feature called the terminal UI (TUI).

The Dagger CLI acts as a client to the Dagger Engine. It can automatically provision a Dagger Engine if needed.

## Engine

The Dagger Engine is the core runtime powering the Dagger platform. It combines an execution engine, universal type system, data layer and module system. It can run on any OCI-compatible system, and is controlled by the Dagger API.

## SDKs

Dagger SDKs provide resources for developing Dagger modules using a familiar language and toolchain. Each SDK provides:

1. A *client generator*, to *consume* the Dagger API with native code.
2. A *server generator*, to *extend* the Dagger API with native code.
3. Examples and reference documentation

## API

The Dagger API is a unified interface for programming the Dagger Engine.

It defines a universal type system based on GraphQL, which can be introspected by any client, and dynamically extended by specially crafted servers. The core features of the Dagger Engine - execution engine, data layer - are available as builtin types.

## Dagger Cloud

[Dagger Cloud](https://dagger.cloud) complements Dagger with a production-grade control plane. Features of Dagger Cloud include workflow visualization and operational insights. Dagger Cloud provides a web interface to visualize each step of your workflow, drill down to detailed logs, understand how long operations took to run, and whether operations were cached.

Dagger Cloud also collects telemetry from all your organization's Dagger Engines, whether they run in development or CI, and presents it all to you in one place. This gives you a unique view on all workflows, both pre-push and post-push.

## Daggerverse

The [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev) is a free service run by Dagger, which indexes all publicly available Dagger modules, and lets you easily search and consume them.
