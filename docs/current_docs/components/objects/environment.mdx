Dagger [modules] are collections of Dagger Functions. When you give a Dagger module to the `LLM` core type, every Dagger Function is turned into a tool that the LLM can call.

Environments configure any number of inputs and outputs for the LLM. For example, an environment might provide a `Directory`, a `Container`, a custom module, and a `string` variable. The LLM can use the scalars and the functions of these objects to complete the assigned task.

The documentation for the modules are provided to the LLM, so make sure to provide helpful documentation in your Dagger Functions. The LLM should be able to figure out how to use the tools on its own. Don't worry about describing the objects too much in your prompts because it will be redundant with this automatic documentation.

Consider the following Dagger Function:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString="sdk">
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">
```go file=../../quickstart/agent/snippets/part1/go/main.go
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">
```python file=../../quickstart/agent/snippets/part1/python/src/coding_agent/main.py
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
```typescript file=../../quickstart/agent/snippets/part1/typescript/src/index.ts
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
```php file=../../quickstart/agent/snippets/part1/php/src/CodingAgent.php
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
```java file=../../quickstart/agent/snippets/part1/java/src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/codingagent/CodingAgent.java
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here, an instance a `Container` is attached as an input to the `Env` environment. The `Container` is a core type with a number of functions useful for a coding environment such as `WithNewFile()`, `File().Contents()`, and `WithExec()`. When this environment is attached to an `LLM`, the LLM can call any of these Dagger Functions to change the state of the `Container` and complete the assigned task.

In the `Env`, a `Container` instance called `completed` is specified as a desired output of the LLM. This means that the LLM should return the `Container` instance as a result of completing its task. The resulting `Container` object is then available for further processing or for use in other Dagger Functions.
