# Concepts

Dagger is a open platform that provides primitive types to use in shell or API call. Instead of relying on static configuration, you can you the Dagger API to dynamically build software delivery pipelines.

## Containers

Containers are the basic building blocks of Dagger and expose a wide range of tools to interact with containers. Getting a container is as simple as calling:

> Note: These examples are using the shell, you can enter the shell by running `dagger` in your terminal.

```shell
container | from alpine
```

```shell
✔ container | from alpine 0.0s
Container@xxh3:0991463b40bf15ca
```

This will return a container based on the image, next lets access a terminal in the container:

```shell
container | from alpine | terminal
```

```shell
● Attaching terminal:
    container: Container!
    .from(address: "docker.io/library/alpine:latest@sha256:a8560b36e8b8210634f77d9f7f9efd7ffa463e380b75e2e74aff4511df3ef88c"): Container!

dagger / $
```

If we wanted to install a package in the container we can do that as well:

```shell
container | from alpine | with-exec apk add go | terminal
```

We now have a container with the `go` package installed!

> Note: If you get stuck, you can always run the `.help` command to get a list of available commands. If you need help with a specific command, you can run `.help <command>` to get more information.

Visit the [Container API](/api/container) documentation for more information on what you can do with containers!

## Directories and Files

Just like the `container` type, the Dagger API also gives you access to `directories` and `files` programatically. You can create directories and files, read and write to them, and even delete them.

Using the `container` example from above, lets put a new file into the container:

```shell
container | from alpine | with-new-file /root/file.txt "my contents"
```

This places a new file in the container at `/root/file.txt` with the contents `my contents`. Now lets retreive the contents of the file:

```shell
container | from alpine | with-new-file /root/file.txt "my contents" | file /root/file.txt
```

Note that just gave use the `file` as `File@xxh3:b4f132f8763f8b2b` which is not too helpful. Lets use the `.help` function to see what we can do with that file:

```shell
container | from alpine | with-new-file /root/file.txt "my contents" | .help file
```

```shell
✔ container | from alpine | with-exec apk add go | with-new-file /root/file.txt "my contents" | .help file 0.0s
Retrieves a file at the given path.

Mounts are included.

USAGE
  file <path> [options]

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
  path string   The path of the file to retrieve (e.g., "./README.md").

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
  --expand bool   Replace "${VAR}" or "$VAR" in the value of path according to the current environment variables
                  defined in the container (e.g. "/$VAR/foo.txt"). (default: false)

RETURNS
  File - A file.

  Use "file <path> | .help" for more details.
```

Lets use the `|` operator to get the contents of the file:

```shell
container | from alpine | with-new-file /root/file.txt "my contents" | file /root/file.txt | contents
```

This will return the contents of the file as a string.

```shell
✔ container | from alpine | with-new-file /root/file.txt "my contents" | file /root/file.txt | contents 0.0s
my contents
```
