# Concepts


## Core Types

Dagger is a open platform that provides primitive types. Instead of relying on static configuration, you can use the Dagger API to dynamically build software delivery pipelines.

### Containers

Containers are one of the basic building blocks of Dagger and expose a wide range of tools to interact with containers. Creating a container is as simple as using the below:

```go
dag.Container().From("node:21-slim")
```

This will create a container based on the `node:21-slim` image.

### Directories and Files

Just like the `container` type, the Dagger API also gives you access to `directories` and `files` programatically. You can create directories and files, read and write to them, and even delete them.

Using the example from above, lets put a new file into the container:

```go
dag.Container().From("node:21-slim").
	WithNewFile("/root/file.txt", "my contents")
```

This places a new file in the container at `/root/file.txt` with the contents `my contents`.

We can also add directories and its common to take a directory from the host machine and place it into a container. Lets update the example to mount a directory from the host machine:

```go
dag.Container().From("node:21-slim").
		WithNewFile("/root/file.txt", "my contents").
		WithDirectory("/src", src)
```

This will place the directory `src` into the container at `/src` and make the contents of the directory available to the container.

:::note
Any changes to the `src` directory will not be synced back to the host machine.
:::

If we wanted to break the example into reusabe and chainable functions, we could move the container creation into a module.

## Modules

The previous section focused on the core types, functions, and chaining provided by Dagger. However, you can write modules that group functions and extend the core API of Dagger.

:::note
Modules are a way to organize your code and make it easier to reuse and share and there are multiple supported SDKs based on your preference.
:::

Let's combine what we learned in the last section into a single module with multiple functions:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"math/rand"

	"dagger/hello-dagger/internal/dagger"
)

type HelloDagger struct{}

func (m *HelloDagger) NewContainer(src *dagger.Directory) *dagger.Container {
	return dag.Container().From("node:21-slim")
}

func (m *HelloDagger) AddFile(c *dagger.Container, path string, contents string) *dagger.Container {
	return c.WithNewFile(path, contents)
}

func (m *HelloDagger) AddDirectory(c *dagger.Container, src *dagger.Directory, path string) *dagger.Container {
	return c.WithDirectory(path, src)
}
```
