# Cache

Dagger caches two types of data:

1. Layers: This refers to build instructions and the results of some API calls. This cache is implemented by Buildkit.
2. Volumes: This refers to the contents of a Dagger filesystem volume and is persisted across Dagger Engine sessions. It is implemented by Dagger (distinct from Buildkit).

## Cache inspection

- Show all the cache entry metadata:

    ```shell
    echo '{daggerEngine{localCache{entrySet{entries{description diskSpaceBytes}}}}}' | dagger query
    ```

- Show high level summaries of cache usage:

    ```shell
    echo '{daggerEngine{localCache{entrySet{entryCount diskSpaceBytes}}}}' | dagger query
    ```

## Cache pruning

The layer cache size configuration is managed by [Buildkit's garbage collector](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/docs/buildkitd.toml.md?plain=1#L83-L94).

To free up disk space used by the cache, use the following command:

```shell
dagger core dagger-engine local-cache prune
```
