# Cache

Dagger caches two types of data:

1. Layers: This refers to build instructions and the results of some API calls.
2. Volumes: This refers to the contents of a Dagger filesystem volume and is persisted across Dagger Engine sessions.

## Cache inspection

- Show all the cache entry metadata:

    ```shell
    dagger query <<EOF
    {
      engine {
        localCache {
          entrySet {
            entries {
              description
              diskSpaceBytes
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    EOF
    ```

- Show high level summaries of cache usage:

    ```shell
    dagger query <<EOF
    {
      engine {
        localCache {
          entrySet {
            entryCount
            diskSpaceBytes
          }
        }
      }
    }
    EOF
    ```

## Garbage collection

The cache garbage collector runs in the background of the dagger engine,
looking for unused layers and artifacts, and clears them up once they exceed
the storage allowed by the cache policy.

The default cache policy attempts to keep the long-term cache storage under 75%
of the total disk, while also ensuring that at least 20% of the disk remains
free for other applications and tools.

The cache policy can be manually configured by editing the `engine.toml` file in the engine
(which uses [BuildKit's syntax config](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/v0.17.0/docs/buildkitd.toml.md?plain=1#L66-L82)).
See the [Custom Runner](./custom-runner.mdx) docs for more information.

## Manual pruning

To manually free up disk space used by the cache, use the following command:

```shell
dagger query <<EOF
{
  engine {
    localCache {
      prune
    }
  }
}
EOF
```
