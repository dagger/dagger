# Dagger Cloud

:::caution Identity verification
Dagger Cloud requires a GitHub account for identity verification. If you don't have one, [register for a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) before proceeding.

## Traces

### Create a Dagger Cloud organization

1. Sign up for Dagger Cloud by selecting a plan on the [Dagger website](https://www.dagger.io/pricing). Dagger Cloud includes plans for both individuals and teams. Click **Continue with GitHub** to log in with your GitHub account.

1. After authorizing Dagger Cloud for your GitHub account, you'll create your organization.

    :::info Naming your organization
    Organization names may contain alphanumeric characters and dashes and are unique across Dagger Cloud. We recommend using your company name or team name for your organization.
    :::

1. Review and select a Dagger Cloud subscription plan.

1. If you selected the **Team** plan:

    1. You will be presented with the option to add teammates to your Dagger Cloud account. This step is optional and not available in the Individual plan.

    1. You will then enter your payment information. After your free 14 day trial completes, you will be automatically subscribed to the Dagger Cloud Team plan.

1. Click **Go to dashboard**. The next step walks you through how to send telemetry to Dagger Cloud.

### Connect to Dagger Cloud

The next step is to connect to Dagger Cloud from your local development environment or from your CI environment.

#### Connect from your local development host

You can visualize and debug your local Dagger pipeline runs with Dagger Cloud to identify issues before pushing them to CI.

To configure for local development, run the `dagger login` command.

:::tip Multiple Dagger Cloud organizations
To use Dagger Cloud locally when you have multiple organizations linked to your account, you must use `dagger login ORGANIZATION-NAME` instead.
:::

The Dagger CLI will invite you to authenticate your device by displaying a link containing a unique key. Click the link in your browser, and verify that you see the same key in the Dagger Cloud Web interface.

```shell
$ dagger login
Browser opened to: https://auth.dagger.cloud/activate?user_code=XXXX-YYYY
Confirmation code: XXXX-YYYY
```

Once you confirm your authentication code, your Dagger CLI will be authenticated and you can now visualize and debug your local Dagger pipeline runs.

:::info
If you do not want to use `dagger login`, set your Dagger Cloud token as an environment variable. For example:
```shell
export DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN={your token}
```
:::

#### Connect from your CI environment

To connect to Dagger Cloud from a CI environment, you require a Dagger Cloud token. Dagger Cloud creates this token automatically when you sign up.

To find your token, browse to the **Organization Settings** page, by clicking your profile photo in the left sidebar and then clicking **Organization Settings**. Select the **Configuration** tab. You can also use this URL pattern: `https://dagger.cloud/{Your Org Name}/settings?tab=configuration`

    ![Get token](/img/current_docs/configuration/get-token.png)

  :::warning
  If you regenerate your token, you must replace the token wherever you've referenced it. To reduce operational interruptions, only regenerate your token if it has leaked.
  :::

Once you have your token, you can use it to connect Dagger Cloud with your CI environment. The general procedure is:

- Add your Dagger Cloud token to your CI environment.
  - Store the Dagger Cloud token as a secret with your CI environment.
    :::danger Keep your Dagger Cloud token private
    You must store the Dagger Cloud token as a secret (not plaintext) with your CI environment and reference it in your CI workflow. Using a secret is recommended to protect your Dagger Cloud account from being used by forks of your project. We provide links in the steps below for configuring secrets with popular CI tools.
    :::
  - Add the secret to your CI environment as a variable named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`.
- If you are using GitHub Actions, install the Dagger Cloud GitHub app for GitHub Checks. This app adds a GitHub check to your pull requests. Each check links to the corresponding pipeline visualization in Dagger Cloud.

You can use Dagger Cloud whether you're hosting your own CI runners and infrastructure or using hosted/SaaS runners.

<Tabs groupId="ci">
<TabItem value="GitHub Actions">

1. Create a new secret for your GitHub repository named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`, and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Refer to the GitHub documentation [on creating repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

1. Update your GitHub Actions workflow and add the secret to the Dagger pipeline step as an environment variable. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and can be referenced in the workflow using the format `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN }}`. Refer to the GitHub documentation on [using secrets in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#using-secrets-in-a-workflow).

    [See an example of a sample GitHub Actions workflow file](../integrations/github.mdx)

1. Install the [Dagger Cloud GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/dagger-cloud). Once installed, GitHub automatically adds a new check for your GitHub pull requests, with a link to see CI status for each workflow job in Dagger Cloud.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="GitLab CI">

1. Create a new CI/CD project variable in your GitLab project named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`, and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Ensure that you configure the project variable to be masked and protected. Refer to the GitLab documentation on [creating CI/CD project variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui) and [CI/CD variable security](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#cicd-variable-security).

1. Update your GitLab CI workflow and add the variable to your CI environment. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`. Refer to the GitLab documentation on [using CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/index.html#use-cicd-variables-in-job-scripts).

    [See an example of a sample GitLab workflow file](../integrations/gitlab.mdx)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CircleCI">

1. Create a new environment variable in your CircleCI project named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Refer to the CircleCI documentation on [creating environment variables for a project](https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).

1. For GitHub, GitLab or Atlassian Bitbucket source code repositories only: Update your CircleCI workflow and add the following pipeline values to the CI environment. Refer to the CircleCI documentation on [using pipeline values](https://circleci.com/docs/variables/#pipeline-values).

    GitHub:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_NUMBER: << pipeline.number >>
    ```

    GitLab:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_NUMBER: << pipeline.number >>
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_TRIGGER_LOGIN: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.user_username >>
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_REPO_URL: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.repo_url >>
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_REPO_FULL_NAME: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.repo_name >>
    ```

    Atlassian BitBucket:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_NUMBER: << pipeline.number >>
    ```

    [See an example of a sample CircleCI workflow](../integrations/circleci.mdx)


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Jenkins">

1. Configure a Jenkins credential named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Refer to the Jenkins documentation on [creating credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/#configuring-credentials) and [credential security](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/#credential-security).

1. Update your Jenkins Pipeline and add the variable to the CI environment. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and can be referenced in the Pipeline environment using the format `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN = credentials('DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN')`. Refer to the Jenkins documentation on [handling credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#handling-credentials).

    [See an example of a sample Jenkins Pipeline](../integrations/jenkins.mdx)

:::note
- This Jenkins Pipeline assumes that the Dagger CLI is pre-installed on the Jenkins runner(s), together with other required dependencies.
- If you use the same Jenkins server for more than one Dagger Cloud organization, create distinct credentials for each organization and link them to their respective Dagger Cloud tokens.
- Typically, Jenkins servers are non-ephemeral and therefore it is not necessary to adjust the `docker stop` timeout.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Argo Workflows">

1. Create a new Kubernetes secret named `dagger-cloud` and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). An example command to achieve this is shown below (replace the `TOKEN` placeholder with your actual token value). Refer to the Kubernetes documentation [on creating secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic dagger-cloud --from-literal=token=TOKEN
    ```

1. Update your Argo Workflows specification and add the secret as an environment variable. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`.

    [See an example of a sample Argo Workflows specification](../integrations/argo-workflows.mdx)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Test the integration

The next step is to test the integration with Dagger Cloud.

#### Test from your local development host

1. In your terminal, call a Dagger Function. You will see a Dagger Cloud URL printed in the terminal.
1. Click on the URL to view details of the run in Dagger Cloud.

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.3.0 call hello
```

#### Test from your CI environment

Trigger your CI workflow by pushing a commit or opening a pull request.

### Public traces

Dagger Cloud automatically detects if the traces produced by your pipelines originate from
a CI system and a public repository. When both conditions are met, Dagger Cloud allows
public access to these traces without requiring an invitation to the organization.

To modify this default setting, navigate to the organization settings page.
Under the `Configuration` tab, toggle the `Trace Repository Visibility` switch to control access
to trace data as needed.

![public traces](/img/current_docs/api/public-traces.png)

## Organizations

A member account grants a person access to log in to a Dagger Cloud organization to diagnose pipeline failures and collaborate on changes. Member information shown on the *All Runs* and *All Changes* pages is populated by the VCS you have integrated with Dagger Cloud. Deleting a member of a Dagger Cloud organization will not remove their runs and changes from Dagger Cloud.

:::important
You must hold the *Admin* role of a Dagger Cloud organization to administer members. You cannot change a member's role. Please contact Dagger Support via the in-app messenger for assistance if you need to change a member's role. This functionality is coming soon.
:::

## Roles and permissions

In Dagger Cloud, users can have one of two roles: *Admin* or *Member*. The Admin role is not a superset of the Member role. If a user needs to administer an organization and view Dagger pipeline runs, ensure that the user also has the Member role.

| Actions | Admin | Member |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| View Dagger pipeline runs and changes |  | ✓ |
| View members of an org | ✓ | ✓ |
| Invite new members to an org | ✓ |  |
| Delete an existing member from an org | ✓ |  |

You cannot change a member's role at this time. Please contact Dagger via the support messenger in Dagger Cloud if you need assistance.
