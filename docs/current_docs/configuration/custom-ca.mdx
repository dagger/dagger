# Custom Certificate Authorities

Dagger can be configured to use custom certificate authorities (CAs) when
communicating with external services like container registries, Git
repositories, etc.

There is additional best-effort support for automatic installation of these
custom CAs in user containers.

Configuring the engine with custom CAs currently requires [provisioning a custom engine](./custom-runner.mdx).

To be applied, the custom CAs should be placed in the
`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` directory of the Dagger container. No
further commands are necessary; the CAs will be automatically installed on
Dagger startup if found in that directory.

<CodeBlock language="shell">
{`docker run --rm \\\n`}
{`    -v /var/lib/dagger \\\n`}
{`    -v $PWD/ca-certificates:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ \\\n`}
{`    --name dagger-engine-custom \\\n`}
{`    --privileged \\\n`}
{`    registry.dagger.io/engine:${daggerVersion}`}
</CodeBlock>

## Configuration applied to user containers

As mentioned above, there is best-effort support for automatically installing
Dagger's custom CAs in all containers created by user pipelines (i.e. those
created via a `withExec` API call).

This is useful so that Dagger code you are not in direct control of (e.g. an
external module dependency) does not need to be forked and updated to use your
custom CAs in order to operate in your network where those CAs may be strictly
required.

The support is best-effort because CAs are not standardized, which means the
exact way they are configured depends on the base image of the container.

Currently, Dagger supports automatically installing custom CAs in images with
the following base distributions:
- Alpine
- Debian-based (e.g. `debian` and `ubuntu`)
- Redhat-based (e.g. `rhel`, `fedora`, `centos`, etc.)

If custom CAs are installed and Dagger detects that one of these base images is
being used, it will attempt to install the custom CAs into the container before
executing it.
* If the installation fails, the error is logged but execution continues
  without the CA being installed.
* When the container exits, the CAs are also automatically removed to prevent
  them from leaking into the cache or into any published images.
