# Engine

Dagger is designed to be run out-of-the-box with sensible defaults.
However, even with these defaults, it may sometimes be necessary to modify various
settings.

To do so, there are two configuration mechanisms: using Dagger's `engine.json`
file (introduced in v0.15.0), or using the legacy BuildKit-style `engine.toml`
file. The `engine.json` file is a configuration file that follows the [Engine configuration file schema](https://docs.dagger.io/reference/engine.schema.json),
while the legacy `engine.toml` file uses [BuildKit's configuration syntax](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/v0.17.0/docs/buildkitd.toml.md)).

:::note
Some options are not yet supported by the newer `engine.json`, so the legacy
`engine.toml` will need to be used for those.
:::

If an option is specified in both `engine.json` and in `engine.toml`, then
the `engine.json` settings will take precedence.

## Configuration

<Tabs groupId="config">
<TabItem value="engine.json">
To configure `engine.json` when using an automatically provisioned Dagger
Engine (the default), you should write your desired JSON config to
`~/.config/dagger/engine.json` (or to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dagger/engine.json` if
set).

Then, when the Dagger Engine is automatically started from a `dagger` command,
it will pull in that configuration. Changes after the Dagger Engine has already
been created and is running will not automatically apply to the new Engine. To
reapply the config after changing it, you'll need to manually stop the Engine.

```shell
docker rm -f $(docker ps -q --filter "name=dagger-engine-*")
```

If you are not using an automatically provisioned Dagger Engine, and have
followed the steps to setup a [custom runner](./custom-runner.mdx), then you'll
need to manually mount your `engine.json` to the engine container's filesystem
at `/etc/dagger/engine.json`. For example:

<CodeBlock language="shell">
{`docker run --rm \\\n`}
{`    -v /var/lib/dagger \\\n`}
{`    -v $HOME/.config/dagger/engine.json:/etc/dagger/engine.json \\\n`}
{`    --name dagger-engine-custom \\\n`}
{`    --privileged \\\n`}
{`    registry.dagger.io/engine:${daggerVersion}`}
</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="engine.toml">
To configure `engine.toml`, a [custom runner](./custom-runner.mdx) is required -
unlike with `engine.json`, the configuration is not automatically mounted to the
engine.

To configure with `engine.toml`, the `engine.toml` file needs to be manually
mounted to `/etc/dagger/engine.toml`. For example:

<CodeBlock language="shell">
{`docker run --rm \\\n`}
{`    -v /var/lib/dagger \\\n`}
{`    -v $PWD/engine.toml:/etc/dagger/engine.toml \\\n`}
{`    --name dagger-engine-custom \\\n`}
{`    --privileged \\\n`}
{`    registry.dagger.io/engine:${daggerVersion}`}
</CodeBlock>

:::note
The `registry.dagger.io/engine` container itself contains a default
`engine.toml` configuration. When mounting `engine.toml`, you may
want to extend the default configuration:

<CodeBlock language="shell">
{`docker run --rm --entrypoint sh registry.dagger.io/engine:${daggerVersion} cat /etc/dagger/engine.toml`}
</CodeBlock>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

### Logging

Dagger supports various log verbosity levels. The default level is to enable `debug`.

<Tabs groupId="config">
<TabItem value="engine.json">
The supported levels are (in ascending levels of verbosity, with the quietest
first, and the noisiest last):
- `error`
- `warn`
- `info`
- `debug`
- `debugextra`
- `trace`

For example, to only show logs of level `warn` and above:

```json
{
  "logLevel": "error"
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="engine.toml">
To explicitly enable debug logging (the default):

```toml
debug = true
```

Conversely, to disable debug logging:

```toml
debug = false
```

To enable trace logging:

```toml
trace = true
```

Conversely, to explicitly disable debug logging (the default):

```toml
trace = false
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Security

By default, Dagger has an open security policy. This policy allows exec
operations to access the `insecureRootCapabilities` options, which effectively
allows all operations root access (similar to [`docker run`'s --privileged` flag](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/run/#privileged).

This capability can be disabled to lock down a Dagger installation.

<Tabs groupId="config">
<TabItem value="engine.json">
To explicitly enable the use of `insecureRootCapabilities` (the default):

```json
{
  "security": {
    "insecureRootCapabilities": "false"
  }
}
```

To disable the use of `insecureRootCapabilities`:

```json
{
  "security": {
    "insecureRootCapabilities": "false"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="engine.toml">
To explicitly enable the use of `insecureRootCapabilities`:

```toml
insecure-entitlements = ["security.insecure"]
```

To disable the use of `insecureRootCapabilities`:

```toml
insecure-entitlements = []
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Rootless mode

"Rootless mode" means running the Dagger Engine as a container without the `--privileged` flag. In this case, the container would not run as the `root` user of the system.

Currently, the Dagger Engine cannot be run as a rootless container; network and filesystem constraints related to rootless usage would currently significantly limit its capabilities and performance.

##### Filesystem constraints

The Dagger Engine relies on the `overlayfs` snapshotter for efficient construction of container filesystems. However, only relatively recent Linux kernel versions fully support `overlayfs` inside of rootless user namespaces. On older kernels, there are fallback options such as [`fuse-overlayfs`](https://github.com/containers/fuse-overlayfs), but they come with their own complications in terms of degraded performance and host-specific setup.

We've not yet invested in the significant work it would take to support+document running optimally on each kernel version, hence the limitation at this time.

##### Network constraints

Running the Dagger Engine in rootless mode constrains network management due to the fact that it's not possible for a rootless container to move a network device from the host network namespace to its own network namespace.

It is possible to use userspace TCP/IP implementations such as [slirp](https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns) as a workaround, but they often significantly decrease network performance. This [comparison table of network drivers](https://github.com/rootless-containers/rootlesskit/blob/master/docs/network.md#network-drivers) shows that `slirp` is at least five times slower than a root-privileged network driver.

Newer options for more performant userspace network stacks have arisen in recent years, but they are generally either reliant on relatively recent kernel versions or in a nascent stage that would require significant validation around robustness+security.

### Garbage collection

The Dagger Engine [caches various operations](./cache.mdx) to improve speed on
subsequent runs of the same pipeline.

The Dagger garbage collector runs in the background,
looking for unused layers and artifacts, and clears them up once they exceed
the storage allowed by the cache policy. This prevents the cache from getting
too large and consuming too much of the available disk space.

:::warning
Take care when configuring the garbage collector manually, and ensure not to
accidentally configure it to clean up *all* cache, since this will severely
impact performance.
:::

<Tabs groupId="config">

<TabItem value="engine.json">
To disable the garbage collector:

```json
{
    "gc": {
        "enabled": false
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="engine.toml">
To disable the garbage collector:

```toml
[worker.oci]
gc = false
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The default cache policy attempts to keep the long-term cache storage under 75%
of the total disk, while also ensuring that at least 20% of the disk remains
free for other applications and tools. The cache policy can be further tweaked
to allow more fine-grained policies.

Each policy defines the amount of space if can consume using the following
parameters:

- `maxUsedSpace` is the maximum amount of disk space that may be used by
  this buildkit worker - any usage above this threshold will be reclaimed
  during garbage collection.
- `reservedSpace` is the minimum amount of disk space guaranteed to be
  retained by this buildkit worker - any usage below this threshold will not
  be reclaimed during garbage collection.
- `minFreeSpace` is the target amount of free disk space that the garbage
  collector will attempt to leave empty - however, it will never be bought
  below `reservedSpace`.

All disk space parameters can be an integer number of bytes (e.g. `512000000`), a
string with a unit (e.g. `"512MB"`), or a string percentage
of the total disk space (e.g. `"10%"`)

<Tabs groupId="config">
<TabItem value="engine.json">
To adjust the garbage collector default parameters:

```json
{
  "gc": {
    "maxUsedSpace": "200GB",
    "reservedSpace": "10GB",
    "minFreeSpace": "20%"
  },
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="engine.toml">
To adjust the garbage collector default parameters:

```toml
[worker.oci]
maxUsedSpace = "200GB"
reservedSpace = "10GB"
minFreeSpace = "20%"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The top level configuration fields (as defined above) for the garbage collector
set the default policy - more specific fine-grained policies are then
generated from this. These more fine-grained policies can also be specified;
however, the defaults for this are generally reasonable for most use-cases.

Each policy takes the same disk space parameters as above, as well as the
following filtering tools:

- `all` is a boolean, that when set to `true` matches every cache record.
- `keepDuration` is a duration, that matches cache records older than the given
  amount (e.g. `30s`, `5m`, `4h`).

<Tabs groupId="config">
<TabItem value="engine.json">

{

        "all": true,
        "maxUsedSpace": "50GB",
        "reservedSpace": "10GB",
        "minFreeSpace": "20%"
      }
    ]
  },
}

<TabItem value="engine.toml">

```toml
[worker.oci]
  keepDuration = "6h"
  maxUsedSpace = "200GB"

  [[worker.oci.gcpolicy]]
  keepDuration = "6h"
  maxUsedSpace = "50GB"
  reservedSpace = "10GB"
  minFreeSpace = "20%"

### Custom registries

Dagger can be configured to use container registry mirrors for any registry
URL. This allows container images that refer to one registry to instead be
redirected to a different one.

<Tabs groupId="config">
<TabItem value="engine.json">

:::warning
Custom registries cannot currently be configured from `engine.json`.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="engine.toml">
For example, to mirror the default Docker Hub `docker.io` registry to `mirror.gcr.io`:

```toml
[registry."docker.io"]
  mirrors = ["mirror.gcr.io"]
```

The configuration can be repeated for multiple registries and mirrors if needed:

```toml
[registry."docker.io"]
  mirrors = ["mirror.a.com", "mirror.b.com"]

[registry."some.other.registry.com"]
  mirrors = ["mirror.foo.com", "mirror.bar.com"]
```

To test the configuration:

```shell
dagger query --progress=plain <<< '{ container { from(address:"hello-world") { stdout } } }'
```

The specified `hello-world` container will now be pulled from the mirror
instead of from Docker Hub.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Custom proxy

Currently, custom proxies cannot be configured through `engine.json` or
`engine.toml`, and must be configured [separately](./proxy.mdx).

### Custom certificate authorities

Currently, custom certificate authorities cannot be configured through
`engine.json` or `engine.toml`, and must be configured [separately](./custom-ca.mdx).
