# Modules

Modules can be configured by editing their `dagger.json` file. The configuration in there contains all module metadata - from the name of the module and the SDK it uses, to the dependencies it requires. An initial configuration is automatically generated when using `dagger init` or `dagger develop` for the first time, and is kept up-to-date with `dagger config`/`dagger install`/etc.

For more information, refer to the [JSON schema for the Dagger module configuration file](https://docs.dagger.io/reference/dagger.schema.json).

## TypeScript

TypeScript-specific SDK settings can be configured using the standard
`package.json` file.

### Alternative runtimes

TypeScript is supported by multiple runtimes: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (via `tsx`), [Deno](https://deno.com/) (natively) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (natively). However, the Dagger TypeScript SDK only supports Node.js (stable) and Bun (experimental).

By default, the TypeScript SDK executes functions using the Node.js runtime, but you can configure an alternative runtime in your Dagger module's `package.json` file.

To change the TypeScript SDK runtime, set the field `dagger.runtime` in your Dagger module's `package.json` file.

#### Node.js

Set the field to `node` to use the Node.js runtime. Node.js is also the default runtime used if this field is omitted.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "node"
  }
```

You can also set a specific version with a suffix (e.g., `node@20.15.0`).

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "node@20.15.0"
  }
```

#### Bun

Set the field to `bun` to use the Bun runtime.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "bun"
  }
```

You can also set a specific version with a suffix (e.g., `bun@1.0.11`).

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "bun@1.0.11"
  }
```

:::warning
Bun runtime support is still experimental. Unexpected results may occur in some cases.
:::

#### Automatic detection

When a runtime is not explicitly defined within the `package.json` file, Dagger automatically identifies the appropriate runtime by examining the project's lock files inside the project's `dagger` directory.

- If Dagger finds any of the following lock files : `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`, it automatically selects `node` as the runtime.
- In the absence of the lock files mentioned above, if a `bun.lockb` file is present, Dagger will choose `bun` as the runtime.
- If no or only unknown lock files are present, `node` is chosen.

:::warning
This behavior however should be seen as a sensible fallback and not as an explicit configuration.

### Alternative package managers

TypeScript can manage dependencies using multiple package managers. The [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime supports [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/), [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/). The [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime supports `bun`.

By default, the TypeScript SDK executes functions using the Node.js runtime with [yarn v1.22.22](https://yarnpkg.com/), but you can configure an alternative package manager or version in your Dagger module's `package.json` file by setting the `packageManager` property.

#### Npm

Set the `packageManager` property to `npm` to use the `npm` package manager. You can also set a specific version with a suffix, as shown below:

```json
  "packageManager": "npm@10.8.2"
```

If no version is specified, `npm@10.7.0` is used by default.

#### Yarn

Set the `packageManager` property to `yarn` to use the Yarn package manager. You can also set a specific version with a suffix, as shown below:

```json
  "packageManager": "yarn@1.22.21"
```

If no version is specified, `yarn@1.22.22` is used by default.

If you use Yarn 3.0 or above, the TypeScript SDK will also generate a `.yarnrc.yml` file in your module's root directory. This file is used to configure the Yarn package manager linker to `node_modules`, which is  required to correctly resolve `@dagger.io/dagger` as local dependencies of your module.

```yaml
nodeLinker: node-modules
```

#### Pnpm

Set the `packageManager` property to `pnpm` to use the Pnpm package manager. You can also set a specific version with a suffix, e.g.:

```json
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.9"
```

If no version is specified, `pnpm@8.15.4` is used.

The TypeScript SDK will also generate a `pnpm-workspace.yml` file in your module's root directory. This file is used to configure the Pnpm package manager, which is required to correctly resolve `@dagger.io/dagger` as local dependencies of your module.

```yaml
packages:
  - './sdk'
```

#### Bun

:::warning
Bun runtime support is still experimental. Unexpected results may occur in some cases.
:::

Setting the `runtime` property to `bun` will use the Bun runtime and its package manager. You do not need to set the `packageManager` field explicitly. Here is an example:

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "bun"
  }
```

#### Automatic detection

When a package manager is not explicitly defined within the `package.json` file, Dagger automatically identifies the appropriate package manager by examining the project's lock files inside the project's `.dagger` directory.

- If Dagger finds any of the following lock files : `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`, it automatically selects the corresponding package manager with a predefined default version: `npm@10.7.0`, `yarn@1.22.22` or `pnpm@8.15.4`.
- If none of the above mentioned lock files are present, but a `bun.lockb` file is present, Dagger will choose `bun` as the runtime and package manager with a predefined default version: `bun@1.0.11`.
- `yarn@1.22.22` is the last default, when nothing mentioned above applies.

:::warning
This behavior however should be considered a sensible fallback, and not as an explicit configuration. Since this default can change, we encourage you to configure a package manager explicitly.
