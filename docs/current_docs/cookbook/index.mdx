# Cookbook

The Dagger Cookbook provides practical, real-world examples for common development workflows. Each recipe shows you how to solve specific problems using Dagger's features and APIs.

These recipes demonstrate patterns you can adapt for your own projects. They cover everything from basic container operations to advanced CI/CD workflows and AI agent integrations. Use your browser's find function (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) to quickly locate specific topics.

---

## Builds

Build and compile applications in reproducible container environments. This section contains practical examples for building artifacts (files and directories) with Dagger.

<MultiStageBuild />

<MatrixBuild />

<BuildMultiArch />

<BuildMultiArchCC />

<BuildImageFromDockerfile />

<BuildImageFromDockerfileContext />

<CacheDependencies />

<ExecuteConcurrently />

<PersistServiceState />

<OciAnnotations />

<OciLabels />

<InvalidateCache />

---

## Container Images

Work with container images and registries. Dagger allows you to build, publish, and export container images, also known as just-in-time artifacts, as part of your Dagger Functions.

<PublishPrivateRegistry />

<PublishPrivateRegistryMultiple />

<ExportContainerImageToHost />

<SetEnvVar />

---

## Filesystems

Manage files, directories, and artifacts across your workflows. This section contains practical examples for working with files and directories in Dagger.

<CloneRemoteGit />

<MountCopyDirectory />

<ModifyCopiedDirectory />

<CopySubsetDirectory />

<CopyPredefinedFilters />

<MountCopyFile />

<CopyFileRuntime />

<ExportDirectoryOrFileToHost />

<RequestFileHttp />

<SetModuleDefault />

---

## Services

Integrate external services into your workflows (databases, caches, APIs). This section contains practical examples for working with services in Dagger.

<UseService />

<ExposeServiceToHost />

<ExposeHostServiceToFunction />

<UseServiceEndpoints />

<CreateServiceForTest />

<StartStopService />

<CreateInterdependentServices />

---

## Secrets

Securely handle sensitive data in your workflows. This section contains practical examples for working with secrets in Dagger.

<UseSecretVariable />

<MountFilesAsSecret />

<DockerfileBuild />

---

## LLMs and Environments

Build AI-powered workflows and agents with LLM integration. This section contains practical examples for working with LLMs and environments in Dagger.

<EnvUseStrings />

<EnvUseContainers />

<EnvUseDirectories />

<EnvUseMultipleTypes />

<BuildCodingAgent />

---

## Errors and Debugging

Handle errors gracefully and build resilient workflows. This section contains practical examples for handling and debugging errors in Dagger workflows.

<HandleErrors />

<ContinueAfterErrors />

<DebugTerminal />

<InspectFilesystem />

<CreateCustomSpans />
