# Cookbook

The Dagger Cookbook provides practical, real-world examples for common development workflows. Each recipe shows you how to solve specific problems using Dagger's features and APIs.

## What You'll Find

These recipes demonstrate patterns you can adapt for your own projects. They cover everything from basic container operations to advanced CI/CD workflows and AI agent integrations.

---

## 🏗️ [Builds](/cookbook/builds)

Build and compile applications in reproducible container environments.

**Examples:**
- Building Go, Python, Node.js applications
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Cross-compilation and multi-platform builds
- Caching build artifacts for faster iterations

---

## 📦 [Containers](/cookbook/containers)

Work with container images and registries.

**Examples:**
- Building custom container images
- Publishing images to registries (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.)
- Multi-platform image builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Image scanning and security best practices

---

## 📁 [Filesystems](/cookbook/filesystems)

Manage files, directories, and artifacts across your workflows.

**Examples:**
- Copying files between host and containers
- Working with Git repositories
- Managing build artifacts
- File filtering and transformations
- Directory synchronization

---

## 🔌 [Services](/cookbook/services)

Integrate external services into your workflows (databases, caches, APIs).

**Examples:**
- Running databases for testing (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis)
- Service health checks and readiness
- Service networking and communication
- Test fixtures and data seeding

---

## 🔐 [Secrets](/cookbook/secrets)

Securely handle sensitive data in your workflows.

**Examples:**
- Loading secrets from environment variables
- Using secrets in builds and deployments
- Integrating with secret managers
- Accessing private Git repositories
- Authenticating with container registries

---

## 🤖 [AI Agents](/cookbook/agents)

Build AI-powered workflows and agents with LLM integration.

**Examples:**
- Creating autonomous CI agents
- Code analysis and review workflows
- Documentation generation
- Automated testing with AI assistance
- Custom AI-powered development tools

---

## ⚠️ [Error Handling](/cookbook/errors)

Handle errors gracefully and build resilient workflows.

**Examples:**
- Error propagation and handling patterns
- Retry logic and backoff strategies
- Graceful degradation
- Debugging failed workflows
- Custom error messages and reporting
