# Dependencies


When you add a dependency to your module with `dagger install`, the dependent module will be added to the code-generation routines and can be accessed from your own module's code.

The entrypoint to accessing dependent modules from your own module's code is `dag`, the Dagger client, which is pre-initialized. It contains all the core types (like `Container`, `Directory`, etc.), as well as bindings to any dependencies your module has declared.

Here is an example:

```shell
dagger install github.com/shykes/daggerverse/helloWorld@26f8ed9f1748ec8c9345281add850fd392441990
```

This module can be accessed from your own module's code, as shown below:

```go
func (m *MyModule) HelloWorld(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
  return dag.HelloWorld().Message(ctx)
}
```
