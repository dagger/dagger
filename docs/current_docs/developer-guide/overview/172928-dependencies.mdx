# Dependencies


Modules can call each other. To add a dependency to your module, you can use `dagger install`, as in the following example:

```sh
dagger install github.com/shykes/daggerverse/helloWorld@26f8ed9f1748ec8c9345281add850fd392441990
```

This module will be added to your `dagger.json`:

```json
...
"dependencies": [
  {
    "name": "helloWorld",
    "source": "github.com/shykes/daggerverse/helloWorld@26f8ed9f1748ec8c9345281add850fd392441990"
  }
]
```

You can also use local modules as dependencies. However, they must be stored in a sub-directory of your module. For example:

```sh
dagger install ./path/to/module
```

The dependent module will be added to your code-generation routines, so you can access it from your own module's code.
