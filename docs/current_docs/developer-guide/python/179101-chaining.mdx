# Chaining


Functions can return objects, including their own. This in turn allows for "chaining"
in the same style as the core Dagger API.

Every call to a function is executed independently by the API, and thus by Python
as well, even if they're in the same object. So long as the object can be
JSON-serialized, its state will be preserved and passed to the next function the
chain.

The following listing shows an example of function chaining, using instance
attributes to share state:

```python file=./snippets/chaining/main.py
```

And here is an example call for this module:

```shell
dagger call with-greeting --greeting=Bonjour with-name --name=Monde message
```

The result will be:

```shell
Bonjour, Monde!
```
