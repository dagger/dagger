# Module Constructor


The main object's constructor is exposed as the entrypoint function for a module.
Its parameters are available as flags in the `dagger call` command directly.

This is a simple way to accept module-wide configuration, or just to set
a few attributes without having to create setter functions for them.

In the Python SDK, the [`@dagger.object_type`][@object_type] decorator wraps
[`@dataclasses.dataclass`][dataclass], which means that an `__init__()` method
is automatically generated, with parameters that match the declared class attributes.

Here is an example with an object that has typed attributes:

```python file=./snippets/constructor/simple/main.py
```

And here is an example call for this module:

```shell
dagger call --name=Daggerverse message
```

The result will be:

```shell
Hello, Daggerverse!
```

Constructor arguments are documented through their attribute documentation,
using the same annotation used on function arguments:

```python file=./snippets/constructor/doc/main.py
```

The flags can be seen documented in the output of `dagger call --help`:

```shell
Flags:
      --greeting string   The greeting to use (default "Hello")
      --name string       Who to greet (default "World")

Function Commands:
  message       Return the greeting message
```

:::note
Dagger Modules have only one constructor. Constructors of [custom types](./817138-custom-types.mdx) are not registered; they are constructed by the function that [chains](./179101-chaining.mdx) them.
:::

## Exclude argument in constructor

Same as any [data class][dataclass], attributes can be excluded from the
generated `__init__()` function, using [dataclasses.field(init=False)][field]:

```python file=./snippets/constructor/exclude/main.py
```

In this case, only the `name` flag was added and is visible in the output:

```shell
Flags:
      --name string      Who to greet (default "World")

Function Commands:
  message       Return the greeting message
```

## Constructor-only arguments

The opposite is also possible. To define an argument that only exists in
the constructor, but not as a class attribute, define it as an
[init-only variable][initvar]:

```python file=./snippets/constructor/initvar/main.py
```

## Complex or mutable defaults

For default values that are more complex, dynamic or just [mutable][mutable],
use a [factory function][factory] without arguments in
[dataclasses.field(default_factory=...)][field]:

```python file=./snippets/constructor/factory/main.py
```

## Asynchronous constructor

If a constructor argument needs an async call to set the default value, it's
possible to replace the default constructor function from `__init__()` to
a factory class method which must be named `create`:

```python file=./snippets/constructor/async/main.py
```
