# IDE Integration


To get your IDE to recognize the `dagger` Python module and any added Dagger module dependencies in the generated client, install the Python SDK in a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) from the generated `./sdk` directory, as shown below:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ./sdk
```

:::tip
If you place the virtual environment (`.venv`) inside the module, don't forget to add it to `.gitignore` and to `"exclude"` in `dagger.json` to avoid uploading those files to the runtime container unnecessarily.
:::

When using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org), instead of the above, add `./sdk` as a development dependency:

```shell
poetry add -e --group=dev ./sdk
```

When using [Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch), update `pyproject.toml` to [allow direct references](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/metadata/#allowing-direct-references), and add a [local](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/dependency/#local) dependency:

```toml
[project]
name = "main"
version = "0.0.0"

[tool.hatch.envs.dev]
dependencies = [
  "dagger-io @ {root:uri}/sdk",
]

[tool.hatch.metadata]
allow-direct-references = true
```

Confirm it was installed:

```
hatch run dev:pip list
```

For other package managers, look for their documentation on how to accomplish the same.

:::note
It's important to install the SDK in editable mode (the `-e` in the `pip install` and `poetry add` commands) so you don't have to reinstall it after a `dagger develop`. However, it's always recommended to reinstall the SDK after upgrading Dagger to cover possible dependency changes.
