# Visibility


TypeScript offers `private`, `protected` and `public` keywords to handle member visibility in a class. However, Dagger will only expose those fields of a Dagger Module that are explicitly decorated with the `@field()` decorator. Other fields will remain private.

:::note
Even if a field remains private, its state will still be loaded and it can be used even though it is not exposed via the Dagger API.
:::

Here's an example of a Dagger Module that has multiple properties which are not exposed outside the module, and a Dagger Function that uses the `crypto` library to hash these:

```typescript file=./snippets/visibility/index.ts
```

From `dagger functions`, it can be seen that `age` and `job` are not exposed:

```shell
dagger functions
Name       Description
identity   Get the identity of the person based on its personal information.
name       Get the name of the person
```

Here is an example call for this module:

```shell
dagger call --name="john" --age=23 --job="devops" identity
```

The result will be:

```shell
c11fb2dc1c5bfe34b0ed5737b8c58914ddb56a83602ead3eff2f06e46efc4a24
```
