# IDE Integration


When opening the generated `dagger/src/main.py` in an IDE, most IDEs will automatically recognize the `@dagger.io/dagger` package, so long as the `tsconfig.json` file has a path configured on it.

For Dagger Modules initialized using `dagger init`, the default template is already configured this way:

```json
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "paths": {
      "@dagger.io/dagger": ["./sdk"]
    }
```

This configuration doesn't require separate installation of the dependency to enable type-hinting or other IDE features.
