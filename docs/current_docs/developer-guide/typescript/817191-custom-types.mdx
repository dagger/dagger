# Custom Types


TypeScript has multiple ways to support complex data types. However, the Dagger TypeScript SDK only supports it through fields (decorated with `@field()`) inside classes because `type` and `interface` keywords do not allows decorators.

Here is an example of a function named `daggerOrganization` that returns a custom `Organization` type, itself containing a collection of `Account` types:

```typescript file=./snippets/custom-types/index.ts
```

:::note
When the Dagger Engine extends the Dagger API schema with these types, it prefixes
their names with the name of the main object:
- Github
- GithubAccount
- GithubOrganization

This is to prevent possible naming conflicts when loading multiple modules,
which is reflected in code generation (for example, when using this module in
another one as a dependency).
:::

Here's an example of calling this module to get all member URLs:

```shell
dagger call dagger-organization members url
```

The result will be:

```shell
https://github.com/jane
https://github.com/john
```
