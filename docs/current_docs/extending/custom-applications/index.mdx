You can extend Dagger functionality by using the SDKs to create Dagger Modules. However, you can also embed a Dagger SDK directly into your application. Both approaches let you access Dagger features for container operations, secret management, and more.

## Installing the SDK

When using a Dagger SDK in your application:

1. Install the SDK for your preferred language
2. Initialize a Dagger client in your code
3. Use Dagger API methods to implement your workflow
4. Run your application with `dagger run`

## SDK Examples

The following SDKs are available for embedding Dagger into your application:

- [**Go →**](./go.mdx) use the Dagger Go SDK to embed Dagger into your Go applications.
- [**TypeScript →**](./typescript.mdx) use the Dagger TypeScript SDK to embed Dagger into your TypeScript applications.
- [**PHP →**](./php.mdx) use the Dagger PHP SDK to embed Dagger into your PHP applications.
- [**Python →**](./python.mdx) use the Dagger Python SDK to embed Dagger into your Python applications.

## Modules vs Custom Applications

Here is a quick summary of differences between these two approaches.

|  | Dagger Modules | Custom applications |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Pre-initialized Dagger API client | Y | N |
| Direct host access | N | Y |
| Direct third-party module access | Y | N |
| Cross-language interoperability | Y | N |
