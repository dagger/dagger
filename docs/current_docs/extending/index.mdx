import DaggerModuleInit from '@partials/_dagger_module_init.mdx';

In addition to providing a set of core types, the Dagger API can also be extended with custom Dagger Functions and custom Types. This is achieved by creating (or installing) Dagger Modules.

When a Dagger Module is loaded into a Dagger session, the Dagger API is dynamically extended with the new Dagger Functions served by that module. Consumers of the Dagger API can now use all of the original Dagger API functions, plus the new functions provided by that module.

Custom Dagger Functions are just regular code, written in your usual language using a type-safe Dagger SDK, and packaged and shared in Dagger Modules.

A Dagger SDK provides two components:

- A client library to call the Dagger API from your code
- Tooling to extend the Dagger API with your own Dagger Functions (bundled in a Dagger module)

The Dagger API uses GraphQL as its low-level language-agnostic framework, and can also be accessed using any standard GraphQL client. However, you do not need to know GraphQL to call the Dagger API; the translation to underlying GraphQL API calls is handled internally by the Dagger SDKs.

Official Dagger SDKs are currently available for Go, TypeScript and Python. There are also [experimental and community SDKs contributed by the Dagger community](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/main/sdk).
