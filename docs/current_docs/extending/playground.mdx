# API Playground

The API Playground was an in-browser tool for testing, running and sharing Dagger API queries. It has since been decommissioned.

The recommended approach is to use the [`dagger query`](./clients-http.mdx#dagger-cli) sub-command, which provides an easy way to send raw GraphQL queries to the Dagger API from the command line.
