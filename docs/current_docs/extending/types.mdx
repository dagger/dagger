import ContainerType from "@daggerTypes/_container.mdx";
import DirectoryType from "@daggerTypes/_directory.mdx";
import EnvType from "@daggerTypes/_env.mdx";
import FileType from "@daggerTypes/_file.mdx";
import CurrentModuleType from "@daggerTypes/_current-module.mdx";
import SecretType from "@daggerTypes/_secret.mdx";
import ServiceType from "@daggerTypes/_service.mdx";

In addition to basic types (string, boolean, integer, arrays...), the Dagger API also provides powerful core types which serve as both arguments and return values for Dagger Functions.

:::note
The types listed on this page are indicative and not exhaustive. For a complete list of supported types and their fields, refer to the [Dagger API reference](https://docs.dagger.io/api/reference).

The following table lists available types and what they represent:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `CacheVolume` | A directory whose contents persist across runs |
| `Container` | An OCI-compatible container |
| `CurrentModule` | The current Dagger module and its context |
| `Engine` | The Dagger Engine configuration and state |
| `Directory` | A directory (local path or Git reference) |
| `EnvVariable` | An environment variable name and value |
| `Env` | An environment variable name and value |
| `File` | A file |
| `GitRepository` | A Git repository |
| `GitRef` | A Git reference (tag, branch, or commit) |
| `Host` | The Dagger host environment |
| `LLM` | A Large Language Model (LLM) |
| `Module` | A Dagger module |
| `Port` | A port exposed by a container |
| `Secret` | A secret credential like a password, access token or key) |
| `Service` | A content-addressed service providing TCP connectivity |
| `Socket` | A Unix or TCP/IP socket that can be mounted into a container |
| `Terminal` | An interactive terminal session |

Each type exposes additional fields. Some of these are discussed below.
