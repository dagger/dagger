# Interactive Debugging

Workflow failures can be both frustrating and lead to wasted resources as the team seeks to understand what went wrong and why. Dagger's interactive debugging feature is an invaluable tool in this situation.

Dagger lets users drop in to an interactive shell when a workflow run fails, with all the context at the point of failure. This is similar to a debugger experience, but without needing to set breakpoints explicitly. No changes are required to your code.

## Example broken workflow

Here's an example of a workflow run failing, and Dagger opening an interactive terminal at the point of failure:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString="sdk">
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">
```go file=./snippets/debugging-1/go/main.go
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">
```python file=./snippets/debugging-1/python/main.py
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
```typescript file=./snippets/debugging-1/typescript/index.ts
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
```php file=./snippets/debugging-1/php/src/MyModule.php
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
```java file=./snippets/debugging-1/java/src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/mymodule/MyModule.java
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Breakpoints

You can also set one or more explicit breakpoints in your workflow, which then starts an interactive terminal session at each breakpoint. This lets you inspect a directory or a container at any point in your workflow run, with all the necessary context available to you.

### Example

Here's another example, which opens an interactive terminal at two different points in a workflow run to inspect the built container:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString="sdk">
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">
```go file=./snippets/debugging-2/go/main.go
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">
```python file=./snippets/debugging-2/python/main.py
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
```typescript file=./snippets/debugging-2/typescript/index.ts
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
```php file=./snippets/debugging-2/php/src/MyModule.php
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
```java file=./snippets/debugging-2/java/src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/mymodule/MyModule.java
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
