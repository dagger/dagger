# LLM Augmentation

Dagger can be used as a runtime and programming environment for AI agents. Dagger provides an `Llm` core type that enables native integration of any Large Language Models (LLM) in your workflows.

A key feature of Dagger's LLM support is out-of-the-box support for [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) using Dagger Functions: an LLM can automatically discover and use any and all available Dagger Functions in your workflow. Other benefits include reproducible execution, end-to-end observability, multi-model support, rapid iteration, and easy integration.

Here's an example of Dagger's LLM support in action:

<Tabs groupId="shell">
<TabItem value="System shell">
```shell
TODO
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dagger Shell">
```shell title="Type 'dagger' to start Dagger Shell in interactive mode and enter the command below."
TODO
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Supported models

Dagger supports a wide range of popular language models, including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Dagger can access these models either through their respective cloud-based APIs or using local providers like Ollama. Dagger uses your system's standard environment variables to route LLM requests.

## Observability

Dagger provides [end-to-end tracing](./visualization.mdx) of prompts, tool calls, and even low-level system operations. All agent state changes are observable in real time.
