# MCP

Dagger can be used as a programming environment for AI agents. Dagger provides an `LLM` core type that enables native integration of Large Language Models (LLM) in your workflows.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) support in Dagger can be broken into three categories:

1. MCP within Dagger
2. Exposing MCP outside of Dagger
3. Connecting to external MCP from Dagger

## MCP within Dagger

A key feature of Dagger's LLM integration is out-of-the-box support for MCP using Dagger Functions: an LLM can automatically discover and use any available Dagger Functions in your Module.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Dagger LLM Agent"]
    subgraph Environment
        B["MCP"]
        B --> C1["Module A"] & C2["Module B"]
        C1 --> D1["Function Discovery A"] & E1["Tool Execution A"]
        C2 --> D2["Function Discovery B"] & E2["Tool Execution B"]
        E1 -- Results A --> B
        E2 -- Results B --> B
    end
    A --> B
```

### LLM Bindings

Here's an example of Dagger's LLM bindings in action:

<Tabs groupId="shell">

<TabItem value="Dagger Shell">
```shell title="First type 'dagger' for interactive mode."
llm | with-container $(container | from alpine) | with-prompt "You have an alpine container. Install tools to develop with Python." | container | terminal
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="System shell">
```shell
dagger <<EOF
llm |
  with-container \$(container | from alpine) |
  with-prompt "You have an alpine container. Install tools to develop with Python." |
  container |
  terminal
EOF
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Agent loop

Consider the following Dagger Function:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">
```go file=../quickstart/agent/snippets/go/main.go
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">
```python file=../quickstart/agent/snippets/python/src/coding_agent/main.py
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">
```typescript file=../quickstart/agent/snippets/typescript/src/index.ts
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This Dagger Function creates a new LLM, gives it an environment (a container with various tools) with an assignment, and prompts it to complete the assignment. The LLM then runs in a loop, calling tools and iterating on its work, until it completes the assignment. This loop all happens inside of the LLM object, so the value of `result` is the environment with the completed assignment.


## Exposing MCP outside of Dagger

Dagger has built-in MCP support that allows you to easily expose Dagger modules as an MCP server. This allows you to configure a client (such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Goose CLI/Desktop) to consume modules from [the Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev) or any git repo as native MCP servers.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["MCP Client<br>e.g. Claude Desktop / Cursor / Goose"] -- "dagger -s -m &lt;module&gt; mcp (stdio)" --> C["Dagger MCP Server: tools"]
    C --> E["Dagger module: functions"]
```

:::warning
Today only modules with no required constructor arguments are supported when exposing an MCP server outside of Dagger.

## Connecting to External MCP Server from Dagger

Support for connecting to external MCP servers from Dagger is coming soon.
