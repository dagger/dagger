# MCP

Dagger can be used as a runtime and programming environment for AI agents. Dagger provides an `LLM` core type that enables native integration of Large Language Models (LLM) in your workflows.

MCP support in Dagger can be broken into three categories:

1. MCP within Dagger
2. Exposing MCP outside of Dagger
3. Connecting to external MCP from Dagger

## MCP within Dagger

A key feature of Dagger's LLM integration is out-of-the-box support for tool calling using Dagger Functions: an LLM can automatically discover and use any and all available Dagger Functions in your workflow. Other benefits include reproducible execution, end-to-end observability, multi-model support, rapid iteration, and easy integration.

Here's an example of Dagger's LLM bindings in action:

<Tabs groupId="shell">
<TabItem value="System shell">
```shell
dagger <<EOF
llm |
  with-container \$(container | from alpine) |
  with-prompt "You have an alpine container. Install tools to develop with Python." |
  container |
  terminal
EOF
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dagger Shell">
```shell title="First type 'dagger' for interactive mode."
llm | with-container $(container | from alpine) | with-prompt "You have an alpine container. Install tools to develop with Python." | container | terminal
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
