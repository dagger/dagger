# Secrets

Dagger supports the use of confidential information, such as passwords, API keys, SSH keys, access tokens and so on, in your pipelines. These "secrets" can be sourced from different secret providers and passed to Dagger Functions as arguments.

Dagger has built-in safeguards to ensure that secrets are used without exposing them in plaintext logs, writing them into the filesystem of containers you're building, or inserting them into the cache. This ensures that sensitive data does not leak - for example, in the event of a crash.

Here's an example of a pipeline that receives and uses a GitHub personal access token as a secret:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">
```go file=./snippets/secrets/go/main.go
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">
```python file=./snippets/secrets/python/main.py
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">
```typescript file=./snippets/secrets/typescript/index.ts
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="PHP">
```php file=./snippets/secrets/php/src/MyModule.php
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The secret can be passed from the host environment via the `env` provider:

Secrets can also be passed using files via the `file` provider (shown below) or from command output via the `cmd` provider:
