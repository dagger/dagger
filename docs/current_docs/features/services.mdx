# Ephemeral Services

Dagger Functions support service containers, enabling users to spin up additional services (as containers) and communicate with those services from their pipelines.

This makes it possible to:
- Instantiate and return services from a Dagger Function, and then:
  - Use those services in other Dagger Functions (container-to-container networking)
  - Use those services from the calling host (container-to-host networking)
- Expose host services for use in a Dagger Function (host-to-container networking).

Services instantiated by a Dagger Function run in service containers, which have the following characteristics:

- Each service container has a canonical, content-addressed hostname and an optional set of exposed ports.
- Service containers are started just-in-time, de-duplicated, and stopped when no longer needed.
- Service containers are health checked prior to running clients.

Some common scenarios for using services with Dagger Functions are:

- Running a database service for local storage or testing
- Running end-to-end integration tests against a service
- Running sidecar services

Here is an example of a Dagger Function that returns an HTTP service, which can then be accessed from the calling host:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">
```go file=./snippets/services-1/go/main.go
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">
```python file=./snippets/services-1/python/main.py
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">
```typescript file=./snippets/services-1/typescript/index.ts
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This also works in the opposite direction: containers in Dagger Functions can communicate with services running on the host. Here's an example of how a pipeline running in a Dagger Function can access and query a MariaDB database service running on the host:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">
```go file=./snippets/services-2/go/main.go
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">
```python file=./snippets/services-2/python/main.py
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">
```typescript file=./snippets/services-2/typescript/index.ts
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
