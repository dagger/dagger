# Shell

Dagger provides an alternative Bash-like syntax for defining a Dagger pipeline. This provides a simpler and more powerful way to call Dagger functions from the CLI.

This can be used in two ways:
- Non-interactive mode: Scripts written in this syntax can be saved and reused, exactly like other shell scripts.
- Interactive mode: An interactive shell is also available with a REPL (Read-Eval-Print loop), offering a fast feedback loop to explore, prototype, or debug.

Key features of the Dagger shell include:

- Bash-like syntax, with dagger functions available as if commands in the $PATH
- No need to specify flags for required arguments, similar to SDKs
- Support for command expansion to feed the output of one command as an argument to another
- Reuse of the same Dagger Engine session for the same script
- Interactive mode (REPL) with persistent command history
- Support for non-interactive one-liners or multi-line scripts
- Ability to execute core and custom Dagger functions
- Includes built-in commands to help navigate or manage a module, or as pipeline helpers

Here's an example of creating and running a simple pipeline in interactive mode.

And here's an example of running the same pipeline (saved as a script) non-interactively:

The `.help` built-in provides a list of available commands, as shown below:

The Dagger shell needs to run in the context of a module, either a local module in the current directory or a remote module referenced using the `-m`, `--mod` flag. The `.doc` built-in command provides documentation on available functions in the module.

Here's an example of exploring a remote module and executing a custom function from it:
