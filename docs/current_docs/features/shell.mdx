# Interactive Shell

Dagger Shell is the fastest way to interact with the Dagger API. Dagger Shell brings the power of pipelines to fully typed API objects while maintaining a familiar Bash-like syntax. With autocomplete for core types, modules, and functions, it makes writing and exploring Dagger pipelines smoother than ever.

Dagger Shell enables you to compose pipelines on the fly, by chaining together core Dagger primitives like `Container` and `Directory` with module-defined types and functions. It can be used inline, with scripts, or interactively. It is secure by design, as all commands execute in containers and you have complete control over what goes in or out from the host system.

Here's an example of Dagger Shell in action:

<Tabs groupId="shell">
<TabItem value="System shell">
```shell
dagger <<EOF
container |
  from alpine |
  with-exec apk add curl |
  with-exec -- curl -L https://dagger.io |
  stdout
EOF
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dagger Shell">
```shell title="First type 'dagger' for interactive mode."
container | from alpine | with-exec apk add curl | with-exec -- curl -L https://dagger.io | stdout
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<VideoPlayer src="/img/current_docs/features/shell-curl.webm" alt="Dagger Shell" />

Here's another, more complex example:

<Tabs groupId="shell">
<TabItem value="System shell">
```shell
dagger <<EOF
container |
  from cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base |
  with-exec apk add go |
  with-directory /src https://github.com/golang/example#master |
  with-workdir /src/hello |
  with-exec -- go build -o hello . |
  file ./hello |
  export ./hello-from-dagger
EOF
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dagger Shell">
```shell title="First type 'dagger' for interactive mode."
container |
  from cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base |
  with-exec apk add go |
  with-directory /src https://github.com/golang/example#master |
  with-workdir /src/hello |
  with-exec -- go build -o hello . |
  file ./hello |
  export ./hello-from-dagger
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
Dagger Shell allows you to execute Dagger Functions as native shell commands, using a Bash-compatible syntax. However, instead of calling a subprocess for execution, Dagger Shell directly interprets commands within the Dagger CLI and executes them in containers. This means that all your commands execute as API calls in a secure, sandboxed environment, rather than as processes with direct access to the host system.
:::

## Modes of execution

Dagger Shell supports multiple ways to run commands:

<Tabs groupId="shell">
<TabItem value="Inline execution">
```shell
dagger -c 'container | from alpine | terminal'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Standard input">
```shell title="First type 'dagger' for interactive mode."
echo 'container | from alpine | terminal' | dagger
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Script">
```shell
echo 'container | from alpine | with-exec cat /etc/os-release | stdout' > script.sh
dagger script.sh
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Interactive REPL">
```shell title="First type 'dagger' for interactive mode."
container | from alpine | terminal
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Built-in help

Dagger Shell provides extensive built-in help:

```shell
.help               # Shows available commands
.help <module>      # Shows description, entrypoint arguments, and available functions
.help <function>    # Shows description, arguments, and return type for function
<function> | .help  # Shows details on the type returned by <function>, including available functions if an object
```

<VideoPlayer src="/img/current_docs/features/shell-help.webm" alt="Dagger Shell help" />

## Navigation

Dagger Shell presents a virtual filesystem to the user. When Dagger Shell starts, it sets the working directory to an initial context, which defaults to the enclosing Git repository or Dagger module. The user can navigate the virtual filesystem by changing the working directory.

The initial context can be a local filesystem path or a remote filesystem. For example, `dagger -m github.com/dagger/dagger/docs@v0.13.0` changes the context to `github.com/dagger/dagger@v0.13.0` and the working directory to `/docs`.

:::note
To safeguard access to the host filesystem, the context root cannot be escaped.
:::

## Modules

If the working directory contains a Dagger module, that module is automatically loaded, and its Dagger Functions can be directly inspected (via `.help`) or invoked.

<VideoPlayer src="/img/current_docs/features/shell-module.webm" alt="Dagger Shell module loading" />

:::tip
If only the core Dagger API is needed, the `-M` (`--no-mod`) flag can be provided. This reduces the startup time because the Dagger CLI doesn't try to find and load a current module.
:::

## Paths

Filesystem paths are handled differently depending on the initial context of the module loaded in Dagger Shell.

- If the loaded module is local, or if no module is loaded, directories or files will come from the host system.
- If the loaded module is remote, directories or files will come from that remote directory.
  - In this latter case, to use files and directories from the host system, they must be referred to using the `host` function.

Here's an example:

<Tabs groupId="shell">
<TabItem value="System shell">
```shell
dagger <<EOF
github.com/dagger/dagger/modules/wolfi@v0.16.2 |
  container |
  with-file /README.md $(host | file ./README.md) |
  with-exec cat /README.md |
  stdout
EOF
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dagger Shell">
```shell title="First type 'dagger' for interactive mode."
github.com/dagger/dagger/modules/wolfi@v0.16.2 |
  container |
  with-file /README.md $(host | file ./README.md) |
  with-exec cat /README.md |
  stdout
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Variables

Dagger Shell lets you save chained function calls in variables and reuse them as needed:

Here's an example:

<Tabs groupId="shell">
<TabItem value="System shell">
```shell
dagger <<EOF
repo=\$(git https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger | head | tree)
env=\$(container | from node:23 | with-directory /app \$repo | with-workdir /app)
build=\$(\$env | with-exec npm install | with-exec npm run build | directory ./dist)
container | from nginx | with-directory /usr/share/nginx/html \$build | terminal --cmd=/bin/bash
EOF
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dagger Shell">
```shell title="First type 'dagger' for interactive mode."
repo=$(git https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger | head | tree)
env=$(container | from node:23 | with-directory /app $repo | with-workdir /app)
build=$($env | with-exec npm install | with-exec npm run build | directory ./dist)
container | from nginx | with-directory /usr/share/nginx/html $build | terminal --cmd=/bin/bash
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Differences from Bash

While inspired by Bash, Dagger Shell introduces key differences:

- API objects as first-class citizens: Instead of executing system processes, you work with structured API objects.
- Pipe operator enhancements: Functions return objects, and piping allows direct access to object methods.
- No host execution: Dagger Shell prevents running commands on the host for safety and consistency.
- Hidden traditional Bash builtins: Dagger Shell prioritizes API interactions over system commands.
