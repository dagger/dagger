# Build an AI Agent

Agentic workflows need repeatability, modularity, observability and cross-platform support. Dagger provides a way to build reproducible workflows in any language with custom environments, parallel processing, and seamless chaining.

This quickstart will guide you through creating and running your first AI agent with Dagger.

The agent will use an LLM of your choosing to solve a programming assignment. The agent will have access to tools to write code and validate it.

## Requirements

This quickstart will take you approximately 10 minutes to complete. You should be familiar with programming in Go, Python,  TypeScript, PHP, or Java.

Before beginning, ensure that:
- you have [installed the Dagger CLI](../../installation.mdx).
- you know [the basics of Dagger](../basics/index.mdx).
- you have a container runtime installed on your system and running. This can be [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Podman](../../../reference/container-runtimes/podman.mdx), [nerdctl](../../../reference/container-runtimes/nerdctl.mdx), [Apple Container](../../../reference/container-runtimes/apple-container.mdx), or other Docker-like systems.
- you have a GitHub account (optional, only if configuring Dagger Cloud)

## Configure the LLM endpoint

Follow the LLM endpoint configuration instructions to configure an LLM for use with Dagger.

:::info
Use environment variables or a `.env` file.
For example: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`
:::

## Configure Dagger Cloud (optional)

:::important
This step is optional and will create a [Dagger Cloud](https://dagger.io/cloud) account, which is free of charge for a single user. If you prefer not to sign up for Dagger Cloud, you can skip this section.
:::

Dagger Cloud is an online visualization tool for Dagger workflows. It provides a web interface to visualize each step of your workflow, drill down to detailed logs, understand how long operations took to run, and whether operations were cached.

Create a new Dagger Cloud account by running `dagger login`:

```shell
dagger login
```

The Dagger CLI will invite you to authenticate your device by displaying a link containing a unique key. Click the link in your browser, and verify that you see the same key in the Dagger Cloud Web interface.

```shell
$ dagger login
Browser opened to: https://auth.dagger.cloud/activate?user_code=FCNP-SRLM
Confirmation code: FCNP-SRLM
```

Once you confirm your authentication code, your Dagger CLI will be authenticated and you will get redirected to your newly created Dagger Cloud organization.

After successfully creating your organization, all future Dagger workflows can be inspected in Dagger Cloud.

## Initialize a Dagger module

In an empty directory, create a new Dagger module. This module will host your agent functions.

You can write your module in Go, Python, TypeScript, PHP, or Java. Choose the SDK you are most comfortable with and run the command below to generate a new Dagger module:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString="sdk">
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">
```shell
dagger init --sdk=go --name=coding-agent
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">
```shell
dagger init --sdk=python --name=coding-agent
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">
```shell
dagger init --sdk=typescript --name=coding-agent
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
```shell
dagger init --sdk=php --name=coding-agent
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">
```shell
dagger init --sdk=java --name=coding-agent
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will generate [various files that make up the Dagger module](../../../extending/modules/modules.mdx), including some boilerplate Dagger Functions as examples.

To see the generated Dagger Functions, run:

```shell
dagger functions
```

You should see information about two auto-generated Dagger Functions: `container-echo` and `grep-dir`.

## Create the agent

Replace the generated Dagger module files as described below.

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString="sdk">
<TabItem value="go" label="Go">

Edit the agent (`main.go`) and replace the generated code with this code:

```go file=./snippets/part1/go/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="python" label="Python">

Edit the agent (`src/coding_agent/main.py`) and replace the generated code with this code:

```python file=./snippets/part1/python/src/coding_agent/main.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

Edit the agent (`src/index.ts`) and replace the generated code with this code:

```typescript file=./snippets/part1/typescript/src/index.ts
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

Edit the agent (`src/CodingAgent.php`) and replace the generated code with this code:

```php file=./snippets/part1/php/src/CodingAgent.php
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="java" label="Java">

Edit the agent (`src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/codingagent/CodingAgent.java`) and replace the generated code with this code:

```java file=./snippets/part1/java/src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/codingagent/CodingAgent.java
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This code creates a Dagger Function called `go-program` that takes an assignment as input and returns a `Container` with the result of the assignment.

- The variable `environment` is the environment to define inputs and outputs for the agent. Each input and output provides a description which acts as a declarative form of prompting.
- The input `builder` is a `Container`. This provides a workspace for the agent to create files and execute commands like `go build`.
- The output `completed` signals the agent that it should return a `Container` representing the completed assignment
- The `environment` is given to an instance of an LLM with a prompt describing how it should complete its work. Prompting can vary depending on which model is being used, and generally requires some experimentation.
- When the LLM decides it is finished, the `completed` container is selected from the `Env` outputs and returned.

## Run the agent

Dagger Shell is the fastest way to interact with the Dagger API, allowing access to both types and Dagger Functions using a familiar Bash-like syntax. Type `dagger` to launch Dagger Shell in interactive mode.

Check the help text for the new Dagger Function:

```shell
.help go-program
```

This should show how to use the `go-program` function.

Make sure your LLM provider has been properly configured:

```shell
llm | model
```

This should show the model you've configured to use with your provider.

Call the Dagger Function with an assignment:

```shell
go-program "write a curl clone"
```

You'll see the agent receive the prompt, write code, validate it, and return a `Container` with the result.

If you signed up for Dagger Cloud, the output of the previous command would have also included a link to visualize the workflow run on Dagger Cloud. Click the link in your browser to see a complete breakdown of the steps performed by the agent.

If the agent fails to write code that passes validation, try adding more helpful guidance to the prompt. If you see an error like "binding value is nil" this means that the LLM did not return a value for `completed`. Try adjusting the prompt to make sure the LLM completes the assignment and returns a `Container`.

Once the agent has successfully returned a `Container`, open an interactive terminal in the container so that you can inspect its work and run the generated code. Notice that the solution is not recomputed since it is still cached from the previous execution:

```shell
go-program "write a curl clone" | terminal
```


Run the program and confirm that it works. This will look slightly different depending on how the LLM wrote the code:

```shell
> ls
# should see a main.go and a go.mod, maybe other files
> go run main.go https://example.com
```

If the program does not look or function as you expect, try adjusting the prompt and input descriptions until you get the desired result.

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've created your first AI coding agent. You can now use this agent to solve coding prompts using an LLM.

Now that you've grasped the basics of building an agent, look at our [agentic workflow examples](../../../introduction/examples.mdx) for more examples and ideas for your next agent.

In the meantime, we encourage you to [join our awesome community on Discord](https://discord.gg/dagger-io) to introduce yourself and ask questions. And [starring our GitHub repository](https://github.com/dagger/dagger) is always appreciated!
