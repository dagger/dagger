# Understand Dagger CLI Telemetry

By default, the Dagger CLI sends anonymized telemetry to dagger.io. This allows us to improve Dagger by understanding how it is used.

Dagger implements the [Console Do Not Track (DNT) standard](https://consoledonottrack.com/) standard. As a result, you can disable the telemetry by setting the environment variable `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` before running the Dagger CLI.

If you are willing and able to leave telemetry enabled: thank you! This will help us better understand how Dagger is used, and will allow us to improve your experience.

The following information is included in telemetry:

- Dagger version
- Platform information
- Command run
- Anonymous device ID

We use telemetry for aggregate analysis, and do not tie telemetry events to a specific identity. Our telemetry implementation is open-source and can be reviewed in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dagger/dagger).
