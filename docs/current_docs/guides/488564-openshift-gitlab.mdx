# Run Dagger on OpenShift with GitLab Runners

## Introduction

This guide outlines how to set up a Continuous Integration (CI) environment with the Dagger Engine on OpenShift in combination with GitLab Runners. The architecture consists of:

* A Dagger Engine DaemonSet which executes the pipelines;
* A GitLab Runner which manages the execution of GitLab CI jobs. For each job, a new Runner worker pod is spawned.
* Tainted nodes for dedicated workload

## Assumptions

This guide assumes that you have:

* A good understanding of how OpenShift works, and of key Kubernetes components and add-ons.
* A good understanding of how Dagger works. If not, [read the Dagger Quickstart](../quickstart/index.mdx).
* A functional OpenShift cluster with the [GitLab Runner Operator](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/operator.html) installed.
* Helm v3.x installed on your local machine to deploy the Dagger Engine on Kubernetes. If not, [install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed on your local machine to communicate with the OpenShift cluster. If not, [install the OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html).
* A GitLab account or self-hosted GitLab instance. If not, [sign up for a free GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/signup).

## Step 1: Install the Dagger Engine

Follow the steps below:

1. Create a `values.yaml` file to configure the Dagger Helm deployment. This includes a set of labels for the pod affinity and the taints and tolerations for the nodes.

    ```yaml file=./snippets/openshift-gitlab/values.yaml
    ```

    This configuration uses the label `builder-node=true` to taint the nodes on which the Dagger Engine should be deployed.

1. Execute the following command for each node that is intended to host a Dagger Engine (replace the `NODE-NAME` placeholder with each node name):

    ```shell
    oc adm taint nodes NODE-NAME builder-node=true:NoSchedule
    ```

1. Install the Dagger Engine using the Dagger Helm chart:

    ```shell
    helm upgrade --create-namespace --install --namespace dagger dagger oci://registry.dagger.io/dagger-helm -f values.yaml
    ```

1. Grant the necessary permissions for the `default` service account in the `dagger` namespace:

    :::info
    Without this step, pod creation will fail due to insufficient permissions to execute privileged containers with fixed user IDs and host path volume mounts.
    :::

    ```shell
    oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n dagger
    ```

## Step 2: Configure GitLab Runner

The next step is to configure a GitLab Runner. Follow these steps:

1. Follow the process to [obtain a runner authentication token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html#create-a-shared-runner-with-a-runner-authentication-token). Note that it is not necessary to register the runner from the command line during this process.

1. Create the configuration for the GitLab Runner as `runner-config.yaml` and `runner.yaml`. Replace the `YOUR-GITLAB-URL` placeholder with the URL of your GitLab instance and replace the `YOUR-GITLAB-RUNNER-TOKEN-REFERENCE` placeholder with the token obtained above.

    ```yaml title=runner-config.yaml file=./snippets/openshift-gitlab/runner-config.yaml
    ```

    ```yaml title=runner.yaml file=./snippets/openshift-gitlab/runner.yaml
    ```

    This configuration uses a similar configuration as that seen in Step 1 for the taints and tolerations and the pod affinity. This ensures that the GitLab Runner worker pods only run on nodes with Dagger Engines.

1. Apply the configuration and deploy the GitLab Runner:

    ```shell
    oc apply -f runner-config.yaml -n dagger
    oc apply -f runner.yaml -n dagger
    ```

## Step 3: Create a GitLab CI/CD pipeline

1. For Dagger Cloud users only, [add a new CI/CD variable in GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui) with the name `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and set its value to the Dagger Cloud token. This variable will be automatically injected into the GitLab job.

1. Create a new GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration file in your repository at `.gitlab-ci.yml` with the following content:

    ```yaml title=.gitlab-ci.yml file=./snippets/openshift-gitlab/.gitlab-ci.yml
    ```

    The most important sections of this configuration are:
        * The `tags` entry, which tells GitLab to use the GitLab Runner which is connected to the Dagger Engine;
        * The `_EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST` variable, which specifies the socket for the Dagger CLI to use.

## Step 4: Run a GitLab CI job

At this point, the deployment is configured and ready for use. Test it by committing a new change to the source code repository, which should trigger the GitLab CI pipeline. Your CI pipelines should now be connected to your Dagger Engines. You can review the job logs either in the GitLab UI under `Build->Jobs` or within Dagger Cloud.
