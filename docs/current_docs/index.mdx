# What is Dagger?

Dagger is a platform for composing and running software engineering workflows. It lets you build workflows from containers, LLMs, files, repositories, directories, and other resources as reusable components that run anywhere with full type safety and automatic caching.

Write function chains once in your preferred language. Run them consistently across local development, CI, and production to boost shipping velocity, improve software quality, and gain complete observability.

Built by the creators of Docker, supported by a vibrant open-source community, and actively used by software teams for real-world automation.
