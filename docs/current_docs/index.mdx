# What is Dagger?

Dagger is a platform for composing and running software engineering workflows - for example, complex integration testing environments, data processing pipelines, and AI agent workflows.

Dagger lets you build workflows from containers, LLMs, files, repositories, directories, and other resources as reusable components that run anywhere, with full type safety and automatic caching.

Dagger is open source and works with any compute platform or technology stack, automatically optimizing for speed and cost.

With Dagger, you:

- Write workflows once in your preferred language
- Run workflows consistently across local development, CI, and production
- Gain complete observability over workflow performance, failures and errors

## Common use cases

- Run workflows in your local development environment, exactly as they run in remote CI
- Enhance existing CI pipelines with LLM-powered code review, tests and feedback
- Improve build times, testing and dependency management in monorepos
- Run tests across multiple versions or platforms in parallel
