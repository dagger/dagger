# What is Dagger?

Dagger is a platform for composing and running software engineering workflows. It lets you build workflows from containers, LLMs, files, repositories, directories, and other resources as reusable components that run anywhere, with full type safety and automatic caching.

Dagger lets you:
- Write workflows once in your preferred language
- Run workflows consistently across local development, CI, and production
- Have complete observability over workflow performance, failures and errors

## Common use cases

- **Portable CI** - Run workflows in your local development environment, exactly as they run in remote CI
- **Agentic CI** - Enhance existing CI pipelines with LLM-powered code review, tests and feedback
- **Monorepo optimization** - Improve build times, testing and dependency management in monorepos
- **Parallel testing** - Run tests across multiple versions or platforms in parallel
