# Dagger Documentation

## What is Dagger?

Dagger is an open-source platform for agentic software. It provides a runtime for composable workflows with **repeatability**, **modularity**, **observability** and **cross-platform support**. 

Dagger excels in two key use cases:
- **Building AI Agents**: Create reproducible, observable AI agents with multi-model support
- **Modernizing CI/CD**: Transform complex pipelines into clean, portable code

## Key Features

- **Interactive CLI:** Directly interact with your workflow or agents in real-time through your terminal. Prototype, test, debug, and ship even faster.

- **Multi-language SDK:** Write your applications in Python, TypeScript, Go, or any language you prefer with type-safe connections. Mix components across language ecosystems and [integrate LLMs](/features/llm) that automatically discover available functions.

- **Composable Runtime:** Containerized execution environment that creates cacheable, reproducible operations even for LLM calls. Works with any compute platform or tech stack, automatically optimizing for speed and cost.

- **Built-in Observability:** Built-in tracing, logs, and metrics that show exactly what's happening at every step. Debug complex agent interactions immediately instead of guessing what went wrong.

## Architecture

Dagger consists of a number of components, all of which work together in an integrated fashion to provide the best possible platform for composable workflows.

### Dagger Engine

The Dagger Engine is the core runtime powering the Dagger platform. It combines an execution engine, universal type system, data layer and module system. It can run on any OCI-compatible system, and is controlled by the Dagger API.

### Dagger CLI

The Dagger CLI is your primary entrypoint to Dagger. It is a full-featured, easy to use tool that can be used interactively from a terminal or non-interactively from a shell script or a CI runner. The Dagger CLI also includes a real-time visualization feature called the terminal UI (TUI).
The Dagger CLI acts as a client to the Dagger Engine. It can automatically provision an engine if needed.

### Client libraries

Client libraries allow controlling the Dagger Engine directly from your code.

To fully take advantage of the Dagger's universal type system, client libraries are automatically generated: the Dagger CLI and SDKs provides the necessary tooling.
This allows for cross-language composition: install any Dagger module as a dependency, and your generated client will include native bindings, regardless of languages.

### SDKs

Dagger SDKs provide resources for developing Dagger modules using a familiar language and toolchain. Each SDK provides:

1) A *client generator*, to *consume* the Dagger API with native code.
2) A *server generator*, to *extend* the Dagger API with native code.
3) Examples and reference documentation

### Modules

Dagger modules are platform-agnostic software components that consume or extend Dagger types.

### Dagger API

The Dagger API is a unified interface for programming the Dagger Engine.

It defines a universal type system based on GraphQL, which can be introspected by any client, and dynamically extended by specially crafted servers.
The core features of the Dagger Engine - execution engine, data layer - are available as builtin types.

### Dagger Cloud

[Dagger Cloud](https://dagger.cloud) complements Dagger with a production-grade control plane. Features of Dagger Cloud include pipeline visualization and operational insights. Dagger Cloud provides a web interface to visualize each step of your pipeline, drill down to detailed logs, understand how long operations took to run, and whether operations were cached.

Dagger Cloud also collects telemetry from all your organization's Dagger Engines, whether they run in development or CI, and presents it all to you in one place. This gives you a unique view on all pipelines, both pre-push and post-push.

### The Daggerverse

The [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev) is a free service run by Dagger, which indexes all publicly available Dagger modules, and lets you easily search and consume them.
