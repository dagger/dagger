If you do not have Homebrew installed, you can use [install.sh](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/blob/main/install.sh):

<CodeBlock language="shell">
{`curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh`}
</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux">

To update the Dagger CLI, run the following:

```shell

## Versioning

The Dagger CLI is released in tandem with the Dagger Engine and thus shares a version number with it. Dagger SDKs automatically provision a Dagger Engine at a compatible version.

The Dagger Engine runner is distributed as a container image at `registry.dagger.io/engine`. Tags are made for the version of each release. For example, the `0.14.0` release has a corresponding image at `registry.dagger.io/engine:v0.14.0`.

Each release notes the compatible Dagger Engine version in its release notes. If running from the CLI, or providing a CLI for the SDK to use via the `_EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_CLI_BIN` variable, check the release notes of the SDK, which indicate the required CLI and Engine versions.

The image below shows an example of the compatibility information available in the release notes:
