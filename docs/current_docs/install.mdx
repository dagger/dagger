# Installation

## Release type

<PartialInstallCli />

## Update

To update the Dagger CLI, use the same method that you originally used to install it. This will overwrite your currently-installed version with the latest (or specified) version.

Homebrew users can alternatively use the following commands:

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade dagger
```

## Uninstallation

Remove the Dagger CLI using the following command:

```shell
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/dagger
```

Homebrew users can alternatively use the following command:

```shell
brew uninstall dagger
```

Next, remove the Dagger container using the following commands:

```shell
docker rm --force --volumes "$(docker ps --quiet --filter='name=^dagger-engine-')"
```

Finally, remove the `dagger` sub-directory of your local cache and configuration directories (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` on Linux or the equivalent for other platforms):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS">

```shell
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/dagger
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/dagger
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux">

```shell
rm -rf ~/.cache/dagger
rm -rf ~/.config/dagger
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Versioning

The Dagger CLI is released in tandem with the Dagger Engine and thus shares a version number with it. Dagger SDKs automatically provision a Dagger Engine at a compatible version.

The Dagger Engine runner is distributed as a container image at `registry.dagger.io/engine`. Tags are made for the version of each release. For example, the {daggerVersion} release has a corresponding image at <code>
{`registry.dagger.io/engine:v${daggerVersion}`}</code>.

Each release notes the compatible Dagger Engine version in its release notes.
