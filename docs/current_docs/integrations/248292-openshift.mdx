# OpenShift

Dagger provides a Helm chart to create a Dagger Engine DaemonSet on an OpenShift cluster. A DaemonSet ensures that all matching nodes run an instance of Dagger Engine.

First, create a `values.yaml` file to configure the Dagger Helm deployment. This includes a set of labels for the pod affinity and the taints and tolerations for the nodes.

```yaml file=./snippets/openshift.yaml
```

This configuration uses the label `builder-node=true` to taint the nodes on which the Dagger Engine should be deployed.

Next, execute the following command for each node that is intended to host a Dagger Engine (replace the `NODE-NAME` placeholder with each node name):

```shell
oc adm taint nodes NODE-NAME builder-node=true:NoSchedule
```

Install the Dagger Engine using the Dagger Helm chart and the configuration above:

```shell
helm upgrade --create-namespace --install --namespace dagger dagger oci://registry.dagger.io/dagger-helm -f values.yaml
```

The Dagger Engine DaemonSet configuration is designed to:

- best utilize local Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) hard drives of the worker nodes
- reduce the amount of network latency and bandwidth requirements
- simplify routing of Dagger SDK and CLI requests

Finally, grant the necessary permissions for the `default` service account in the `dagger` namespace:

:::warning
Without this step, pod creation will fail due to insufficient permissions to execute privileged containers with fixed user IDs and host path volume mounts.
:::

```shell
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n dagger
```
