# Podman

Podman is CLI-compatible with Docker and therefore can be used by creating a symbolic link to the Podman executable in your system path and naming it `docker`:

```shell
sudo ln -s $(which podman) /usr/local/bin/docker
```

:::note
RHEL 8.x users may need to additionally execute `modprobe iptable_nat`.
