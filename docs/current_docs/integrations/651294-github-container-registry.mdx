# GitHub Container Registry with GitHub Actions

The following code sample demonstrates how to push a container image built in Dagger to GitHub's Container Registry (ghcr.io).

```yaml title=".github/workflows/dagger.yml" file=./snippets/ghcr-workflow.yml
```

This is how you acquire `packages: write` permission, then call the `dagger-for-github` module with `DOCKER_REGISTRY`, `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`, `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` set appropriately.

Copy and edit appropriately :-)

Note: when specifying the args for the dagger module, you have to use `--registry=$DOCKER_REGISTRY` syntax for the non-secrets (regular strings), and `--password=env:DOCKER_PASSWORD` syntax for the secrets. This is because dagger only supports the `env:` syntax for secrets.

Nothing in the dagger module is specific to GHCR, it's just:

* Build the container in the usual way with Dagger. Here we make a cowsay
  container that says "How now, brown cow", showing how to pass build context
  from the filesystem
* Use `ctr.WithRegistryAuth(registry, username, password).Publish(ctx, registry+"/"+imageName)`
  to publish the container to the ghcr registry.

Here's the complete [`dagger/main.go`](https://github.com/lukemarsden/dagger-ghcr-demo/blob/main/dagger/main.go):

```yaml title="dagger/main.go" file=./snippets/ghcr-main.go
```

And you can see the resulting published container images: [https://github.com/lukemarsden/dagger-ghcr-demo/pkgs/container/dagger-ghcr-demo](https://github.com/lukemarsden/dagger-ghcr-demo/pkgs/container/dagger-ghcr-demo)

Run it to see the cow:
```
docker run ghcr.io/lukemarsden/dagger-ghcr-demo:latest
```
```

Try forking the `dagger-ghcr-demo` repo and updating `cow.txt` to your favorite cow pun (e.g. "Dagger is udderly great"), commit and push.
