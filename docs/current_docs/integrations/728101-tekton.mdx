# Tekton

The following code sample demonstrates how to integrate Dagger with Tekton.

:::note
This Tekton sample assumes that the `git-clone` Task from Tekton Hub is already installed. This Task adds repository cloning capabilities to the Tekton Pipeline. To install the `git-clone` Task, use the following command:

```shell
tkn hub install task git-clone
```
:::

The following Tekton Pipeline checks out the project into a Tekton Workspace and runs the `dagger` Tekton Task:

```yaml title="git-pipeline.yaml" file=./snippets/tekton-git-pipeline.yaml
```

The following Tekton Task installs the Dagger CLI and calls a Dagger Function. In this Tekton Task, the Dagger Engine runs as a sidecar and shares a socket with the Task itself. The Task uses `dind` as its runtime in order to have Docker available.

```yaml title="dagger-task.yaml" file=./snippets/tekton-dagger-task.yaml
```

The following Tekton PipelineRun runs the Tekton Pipeline:

```yaml title="git-pipeline-run.yaml" file=./snippets/tekton-git-pipeline-run.yaml
```

To apply the configuration and run the Tekton Pipeline, use the following commands:

```shell
kubectl apply -f dagger-task.yaml
kubectl apply -f git-pipeline-yaml
kubectl create -f git-pipeline-run.yaml
```

To see the logs from the PipelineRun, obtain the PipelineRun name from the output and run `tkn pipelinerun logs clone-read-run-<id> -f`.
