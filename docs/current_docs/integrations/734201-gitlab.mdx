# GitLab CI

The following code samples demonstrate how to integrate Dagger with GitLab CI.

## Docker executor

The following code listing illustrates Dagger usage in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, assuming either [GitLab-hosted runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/index.html) using the (default) [Docker Machine executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker_machine.html) or [self-managed GitLab Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/index.html) using the [Docker executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html). In both these cases, the Dagger Engine is provisioned "just in time" using a Docker-in-Docker (`dind`) service.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml" file=./snippets/gitlab-docker.yml
```

## Kubernetes executor

The following code listing illustrates Dagger usage in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, assuming [self-managed GitLab Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/index.html) in a Kubernetes cluster and using the [Kubernetes executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes/).

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml" file=./snippets/gitlab-kubernetes.yml
```

In this case, each GitLab Runner must be configured to only run on nodes with pre-provisioned instances of the Dagger Engine. This is achieved using taints and tolerations on the nodes, and pod affinity.

The following code listings illustrate the configuration to be applied to each GitLab Runner, with taints, tolerations and pod affinity set via the `dagger-node` key. For an example of the corresponding node configuration, refer to the [OpenShift](./248292-openshift.mdx) integration page.

To use this configuration, replace the YOUR-GITLAB-URL placeholder with the URL of your GitLab instance and replace the YOUR-GITLAB-RUNNER-TOKEN-REFERENCE placeholder with your [GitLab Runner authentication token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html#create-a-shared-runner-with-a-runner-authentication-token).

```yaml title="runner-config.yml" file=./snippets/gitlab-runner-config.yml
```

```yaml title="runner.yml" file=./snippets/gitlab-runner.yml
```
