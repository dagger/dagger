# PHP

Dagger can be used to perform common CI tasks - testing, containerizing, publishing and more - for any PHP application.

The following code sample demonstrates how these CI tasks can be encapsulated as Dagger Functions in a Dagger module. It assumes:

- A PHP 8.2.x Web application with:
  - Composer for package management
  - PHPUnit for application testing
- Credentials to publish the containerized application image to a registry

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

Bootstrap a new module:

```shell
dagger init --name=my-module --sdk=go
```

Update the generated `dagger/main.go` file with the following code:

```go file=./snippets/php/go/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

Bootstrap a new module:

```shell
dagger init --name=my-module --sdk=python
```

Update the generated `dagger/src/main/__init__.py` file with the following code:

```python file=./snippets/php/python/main.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

Bootstrap a new module:

```shell
dagger init --name=my-module --sdk=typescript
```

Update the generated `dagger/src/index.ts` file with the following code:

```typescript file=./snippets/php/typescript/index.ts
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::warning
The code sample above is illustrative only. Modify it to your application's specific requirements.

Here is an example of calling the Dagger Function to run an application's unit tests:

```shell
dagger call test --source=.
```

Here is an example of calling the Dagger Function to publish the application image to Docker Hub. Replace the `DOCKER-HUB-USERNAME` and `DOCKER-HUB-PASSWORD` placeholders with your Docker Hub credentials.

```shell
export REGISTRY_PASSWORD=DOCKER-HUB-PASSWORD
dagger call publish \
  --source=. \
  --version=0.1 \
  --registry-address=docker.io \
  --registry-username=DOCKER-HUB-USERNAME \
  --registry-password=env:REGISTRY_PASSWORD \
  --image-name=my-php-app
```

Some PHP applications may need to perform specific operations on startup, such as running database migrations or reading/writing cache data. This can be accomplished by overriding the container's default entrypoint with a custom entrypoint script for startup operations.

To use such a script, uncomment the relevant lines in the code sample above and create a script named `docker-entrypoint.sh` in the application directory. Here is an example of one such script, which runs database migrations for a Laravel Web application at startup:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
php artisan migrate
apache2-foreground
```
