# Argo Workflows

Dagger provides a programmable container engine that can be invoked from an Argo Workflow to run a Dagger pipeline. This allows you to benefit from Dagger's caching, debugging, and visualization features, whilst still keeping all of your existing Argo Workflows infrastructure.

## How it works

Dagger is invoked like any other tool, as one step of an Argo Workflow. Argo Workflows executes the Dagger CLI in a container and connects to the Dagger Engine running in a sidecar container.

## Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster [configured for use with Dagger](./kubernetes.mdx) and with a pre-configured `kubectl` profile
- Argo Workflows [installed](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/blob/master/docs/quick-start.md) in the cluster

## Example

The following example runs the tests for a simple [Go application](https://github.com/kpenfound/greetings-api) using a Dagger Function. This project uses the Dagger Go SDK for CI.

Create a file called `workflow.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml title="workflow.yaml" file=./snippets/argo-workflow.yaml template
```

A few important points to note:

- The workflow uses hardwired artifacts to clone the Git repository and to install the Dagger CLI.
- `unix:///var/run/dagger/buildkitd.sock` is mounted and specified with the `_EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST` environment variable.
- The Dagger CLI is downloaded and installed. Confirm the version and architecture are accurate for your cluster and project.
- Setting the `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable is only necessary if integrating with Dagger Cloud.

When you're satisfied with the workflow configuration, run it with Argo:

`argo submit -n argo --watch ./workflow.yaml`

The `--watch` argument provides an ongoing status feed of the workflow request in Argo. To see the logs from your workflow, note the pod name and in another terminal run `kubectl logs -f POD_NAME`

Once the workflow has successfully completed, run it again with `argo submit -n argo --watch ./workflow.yaml`. Dagger's caching should result in a significantly faster second execution.

:::note
Argo Workflows is not a full-featured CI platform in itself, and won't directly respond to changes in repositories or have any automated triggers. To use Argo Workflows as a CI server, it should be [paired with other tools](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/ci-cd/) like Argo Events.

- [Video: Argo Workflows with Dagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWOJO2PAQIo) by Kyle Penfound: In this demo, Kyle demonstrates how to use Dagger to define pipelines in code and then use argo Workflows to orchestrate the execution of those pipelines.
