# Azure Pipelines

Dagger provides a programmable container engine that allows you to replace your YAML Azure Pipelines definitions with Dagger Functions written in a regular programming language. This allows you to execute your pipeline the same way locally and in CI, with the additional benefit of intelligent caching.

## How it works

When running a CI pipeline with Dagger using Azure Pipelines, the general workflow looks like this:

1. Azure Pipelines receives a trigger based on a repository event.
1. Azure Pipelines begins processing the steps in the `azure-pipelines.yml` file.
1. Azure Pipelines downloads the Dagger CLI.
1. Azure Pipelines executes one (or more) Dagger CLI commands, such as `dagger call ...`.
1. The Dagger CLI attempts to find an existing Dagger Engine or spins up a new one inside the Azure Pipelines runner.
1. The Dagger CLI calls the specified Dagger Function and sends telemetry to Dagger Cloud if the `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable is set.
1. The pipeline completes with success or failure. Logs appear in Azure Pipelines as usual.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure DevOps organization and project
- An Azure Pipelines agent to run jobs connected to the project

## Examples

### Docker executor

The following example demonstrates how to call a Dagger Function in an Azure Pipeline.

```yaml title="azure-pipelines.yml" file=./snippets/azure-pipelines-hello.yml
```

The following is a more complex example demonstrating how to create an Azure Pipeline that checks out source code, calls a Dagger Function to test the project, and then calls another Dagger Function to build and publish a container image of the project. This example uses a simple [Go application](https://github.com/kpenfound/greetings-api) and assumes that you have already imported it into your Azure DevOps project repository.

```yaml title="azure-pipelines.yml" file=./snippets/azure-pipelines-test-build.yml
```
