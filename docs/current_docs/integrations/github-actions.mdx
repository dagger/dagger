# GitHub Actions

Dagger provides a GitHub Action that can be used in any GitHub Actions workflow to call one or more Dagger Functions on specific events, such as a new commit.

## How it works

When running a CI pipeline with Dagger using a standard GitHub Actions runner, the general workflow looks like this:

1. GitHub receives a workflow trigger based on a repository event.
1. GitHub begins processing the jobs and steps in the workflow.
1. GitHub finds the "Dagger for GitHub" action and passes control to it.
1. The "Dagger for GitHub" action calls the Dagger CLI with the specified sub-command, module, function name, and arguments.
1. The Dagger CLI attempts to find an existing Dagger Engine or spins up a new one inside the GitHub Actions runner.
1. The Dagger CLI executes the specified sub-command and sends telemetry to Dagger Cloud if the `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable is set.
1. The workflow completes with success or failure. Logs appear in GitHub as usual.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository

## Examples

The following example demonstrates how to call a Dagger Function on a standard GitHub runner in a GitHub Actions workflow.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/dagger.yml" file=./snippets/github-hello.yml
```

The following is a more complex example demonstrating how to create a GitHub Actions workflow that checks out source code, calls a Dagger Function to test the project, and then calls another Dagger Function to build and publish a container image of the project. This example uses a simple [Go application](https://github.com/kpenfound/greetings-api) and assumes that you have already forked it in your own GitHub repository.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/dagger.yml" file=./snippets/github-test-build.yml
```

More information is available in the [Dagger for GitHub page](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dagger-for-github).

### SSH configuration

When using SSH keys in GitHub Actions, ensure proper SSH agent setup:

```yaml
- name: Set up SSH
  run: |
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add - <<< '${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}'
```

Replace `${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}` with your provider secret containing the private key.
