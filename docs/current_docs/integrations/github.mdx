# GitHub

## Authentication for Private Repositories

When working with private repositories in GitHub Actions, see our [Git Credential Helpers Guide](/guides/ci/git-credential-helpers#github) for authentication patterns. For private modules, refer to the [Remote Repositories documentation](/manuals/user/remote-repositories).

## Examples

Given a Dagger Function called `foo` that accepts a `Directory` as argument, you can pass it a GitHub pull request URL as argument like this:

dagger call foo --directory=https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY#pull/NUMBER/merge

If your GitHub repository contains a Dagger module, you can test the functionality of a specific branch by calling the Dagger module with the corresponding pull request URL, as shown below:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY@pull/NUMBER/merge --help
```

You can also use a Dagger Function in a GitHub Actions workflow to publish a container image to GitHub Container Registry.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/dagger.yml" file=./snippets/github-ghcr.yml
```
