# GitHub

Dagger can directly interact with GitHub pull requests, making it easy to test the functionality of specific forks or branches of a GitHub repository.

Dagger also supports publishing container images to [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

## How it works

GitHub contains a shorthand redirect at the `/merge` endpoint that allows you to reference the correct branch of a repository from a pull request (PR), without needing to know anything about the fork or branch where the PR came from.

By default, the Dagger `Directory` type works with both local directories and [remote Git repositories](../../cookbook#copy-a-directory-or-remote-repository-to-a-container). This makes it possible to work with the directory tree at the root of a Git repository or a given branch.

By combining these two features, Dagger users can write Dagger Functions that directly use GitHub pull requests as arguments.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository

## Examples

Given a Dagger Function called `foo` that accepts a `Directory` as argument, you can pass it a GitHub pull request URL as argument like this:

```shell
dagger call foo --directory=https://github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY#pull/NUMBER/merge
```

If your GitHub repository contains a Dagger module, you can test the functionality of a specific branch by calling the Dagger module with the corresponding pull request URL, as shown below:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY@pull/NUMBER/merge --help
```

You can also use a Dagger Function in a GitHub Actions workflow to publish a container image to GitHub Container Registry.

```yaml title=".github/workflows/dagger.yml" file=./snippets/github-ghcr.yml
```

## About GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a popular Web-based platform used for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store and manage their code in repositories, track changes over time, and collaborate with other developers on projects.
