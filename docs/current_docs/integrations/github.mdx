# GitHub

There are some GitHub-specific features that make the DX for working with Dagger even better.

:::note
There is a separate [integration guide for Github Actions](./github-actions.mdx)
:::

## Examples

### Working with Pull Requests

By default the Dagger `Directory` type accepts a [remote Git repository as an input](../../cookbook#copy-a-directory-or-remote-repository-to-a-container). This makes it easy to work with the directory tree at the root of a repository or a given branch.

GitHub contains a shorthand redirect at the `/merge` endpoint that allows you to reference the correct branch of a repository from a PR without needing to know anything about the fork or branch where the PR came from.

For a function called `foo` that accepts a `Directory` as input you can use a GitHub Pull Request URL as an input like this:

```
dagger call foo --directory=https://github.com/FOO/BAR#pull/NUMBER/merge
```

If you're developing a Dagger module and want to test out the functionality as it exists in a given PR you can call this PR directly like this: 

```
dagger call -m github.com/FOO/BAR@pull/NUMBER/merge --help
```

## About GitHub

GitHub is a popular web-based platform used for version control and collaboration in software development. It allows developers to store and manage their code in repositories, track changes over time, and collaborate with other developers on projects.
