# GitLab CI

Dagger provides a programmable container engine that allows you to replace your YAML pipeline definitions in GitLab with Dagger Functions written in a regular programming language. This allows you to execute your pipeline the same locally and in GitLab, with the additional benefit of intelligent caching.

## How it works

When running a CI pipeline with Dagger using GitLab CI, the general workflow looks like this:

1. GitLab receives a trigger based on a repository event.
1. GitLab begins processing the stages and jobs in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
1. GitLab downloads the Dagger CLI.
1. GitLab executes one (or more) Dagger CLI commands, such as `dagger call ...`.
1. The Dagger CLI attempts to find an existing Dagger Engine or spins up a new one inside the GitLab runner.
1. The Dagger CLI calls the specified Dagger Function and sends telemetry to Dagger Cloud if the `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable is set.
1. The pipeline completes with success or failure. Logs appear in GitLab as usual.

## Prerequisites

- A GitLab repository
- Any one of the following:
  - [GitLab-hosted runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/index.html) using the (default) [Docker Machine executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker_machine.html)
  - [Self-managed GitLab Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/index.html) using the [Docker executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html).
  - [Self-managed GitLab Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/index.html) in a Kubernetes cluster and using the [Kubernetes executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes/).

## Examples

### Docker executor

The following example demonstrates how to call a Dagger Function in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline using the (default) [Docker Machine executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker_machine.html) or the [Docker executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html). In both these cases, the Dagger Engine is provisioned "just in time" using a Docker-in-Docker (`dind`) service.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml" file=./snippets/gitlab-docker-hello.yml
```

The following is a more complex example demonstrating how to create a GitLab pipeline that checks out source code, calls a Dagger Function to test the project, and then calls another Dagger Function to build and publish a container image of the project. This example uses a simple [Go application](https://github.com/kpenfound/greetings-api) and assumes that you have already forked it in your own GitLab repository.

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml" file=./snippets/gitlab-docker-test-build.yml
```

### Kubernetes executor

The following example demonstrates how to call a Dagger Function in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline using the [Kubernetes executor](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/kubernetes/).

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml" file=./snippets/gitlab-kubernetes-hello.yml
```

```

In both cases, each GitLab Runner must be configured to only run on nodes with pre-provisioned instances of the Dagger Engine. This is achieved using taints and tolerations on the nodes, and pod affinity.

The following code listings illustrate the configuration to be applied to each GitLab Runner, with taints, tolerations and pod affinity set via the `dagger-node` key. For an example of the corresponding node configuration, refer to the [OpenShift](./openshift.mdx) integration page.

To use this configuration, replace the YOUR-GITLAB-URL placeholder with the URL of your GitLab instance and replace the YOUR-GITLAB-RUNNER-TOKEN-REFERENCE placeholder with your [GitLab Runner authentication token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html#create-a-shared-runner-with-a-runner-authentication-token).

```yaml title="runner.yml" file=./snippets/gitlab-runner.yml
```

## About GitLab

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) is a popular Web-based platform used for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to store and manage their code in repositories, track changes over time, and collaborate with other developers on projects.
