# Google Cloud Run

## Requirements

The following code sample demonstrates how to build and deploy an application on Google Cloud Run using a Dagger module. It assumes:

- A Node.js Web application
- A Google Cloud service account with all necessary privileges and with the Google Cloud APIs enabled
- A Google Cloud Run service with a public URL and defined resource/capacity/access rules
- A Google Artifact Registry repository

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

In the application directory, create a new Dagger module:

```shell
dagger init --name=my-module --sdk=go --source=./dagger
```

Install the Google Cloud Run module from the Daggerverse:

```shell
dagger install github.com/vvaswani/daggerverse/google-cloud-run
```

Update the generated `dagger/main.go` file with the following code:

```go file=./snippets/google-cloud-run/go/main.go
```

This Dagger module contains three Dagger Functions. Let's look at each in detail.

The `Build()` function takes care of building the application image.
  - It accepts one argument: a `Directory` representing the directory containing the application source code.
  - It uses the client's `Container().From()` method to initialize a new container from a base image. In this example, the base image is the `node:21` image. This method returns a `Container` representing an OCI-compatible container image.
  - It uses the `Container.WithDirectory()` method to return the container image with the application source code written at the `/home/node` path, and the `Container.WithWorkdir()` method to set the working directory in the container.
  - It chains the `Container.WithExec()` method again to install dependencies with `npm install` and sets the container entrypoint using the `Container.WithEntrypoint()` method.

The `Publish()` function takes care of publishing the container image to Google Artifact Registry.
  - It accepts six arguments: the Go context, a `Directory` representing the directory containing the application source code, and strings representing the Google Cloud project name, Google Artifact Registry location and Google Artifact Registry repository name, and a `Secret` representing Google Cloud credentials.
  - It invokes the `Build()` function to produce a `Container` representing the application image.
  - It uses the `Container.Publish()` method to publish the container to the Google Artifact Registry repository and returns the SHA identifier of the published image.

The `Deploy()` function takes care of deploying the application to an existing Google Cloud Run service.
  - It accepts eight arguments: the Go context, a `Directory` representing the directory containing the application source code, and strings representing the Google Cloud project name, Google Artifact Registry location, Google Artifact Registry repository name, Google Cloud Run service location, Google Cloud Run service name, and a `Secret` representing Google Cloud credentials.
  - It invokes the `Publish()` function to build and publish a `Container` representing the application image.
  - It uses the Google Cloud Run module to deploy the container image to the named Google Cloud Run service.

In the application directory, create a new Dagger module:

```shell
dagger init --name=my-module --sdk=python --source=./dagger

Install the Google Cloud Run module from the Daggerverse:

```shell
dagger install github.com/vvaswani/daggerverse/google-cloud-run

Update the generated `dagger/src/main/__init__.py` file with the following code.

```python file=./snippets/google-cloud-run/python/main.py
```

This Dagger module contains three Dagger Functions. Let's look at each in detail.

The `build()` function takes care of building the application image.
  - It accepts one argument: a `Directory` representing the directory containing the application source code.
  - It uses the client's `Container().from_()` method to initialize a new container from a base image. In this example, the base image is the `node:21` image. This method returns a `Container` representing an OCI-compatible container image.
  - It uses the `Container.with_directory()` method to return the container image with the application source code written at the `/home/node` path, and the `Container.with_workdir()` method to set the working directory in the container.
  - It chains the `Container.with_exec()` method again to install dependencies with `npm install` and sets the container entrypoint using the `Container.with_entrypoint()` method.

The `publish()` function takes care of publishing the container image to Google Artifact Registry.
  - It accepts five arguments: a `Directory` representing the directory containing the application source code, and strings representing the Google Cloud project name, Google Artifact Registry location and Google Artifact Registry repository name, and a `Secret` representing Google Cloud credentials.
  - It invokes the `build()` function to produce a `Container` representing the application image.
  - It uses the `Container.publish()` method to publish the container to the Google Artifact Registry repository and returns the SHA identifier of the published image.

The `deploy()` function takes care of deploying the application to an existing Google Cloud Run service.
  - It accepts seven arguments: a `Directory` representing the directory containing the application source code, and strings representing the Google Cloud project name, Google Artifact Registry location, Google Artifact Registry repository name, Google Cloud Run service location, Google Cloud Run service name, and a `Secret` representing Google Cloud credentials.
  - It invokes the `publish()` function to build and publish a `Container` representing the application image.
  - It uses the Google Cloud Run module to deploy the container image to the named Google Cloud Run service

:::warning
The code sample above is illustrative only. Modify it to your application's specific requirements.
:::

Here is an example of calling the Dagger Function to deploy the application to Google Cloud Run. Remember to update the `registry-location`, `repository`, `service`, and `service-location` arguments, and update the `SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY-FILE` placeholder with the local filesystem path to your JSON service key file.

```shell
dagger call deploy \
  --source=. \
  --project=myproject \
  --registry-location=us-central1 \
  --repository=myregistry/myapp \
  --service-location=us-central1 \
  --service=myservice \
  --credential=file:SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY-FILE
```
