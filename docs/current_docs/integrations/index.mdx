This section provides information and code samples to help you integrate Dagger with other tools and platforms.

## CI Integrations

Dagger can be integrated with various CI systems to run workflows as part of your continuous integration pipeline. This allows you to execute Dagger Functions in response to code changes, pull requests, or other events in your CI system.

- [Argo Workflows](./argo-workflows.mdx)
- [AWS CodeBuild](./aws-codebuild.mdx)
- [Azure Pipelines](./azure-pipelines.mdx)
- [CircleCI](./circleci.mdx)
- [GitHub Actions](./github-actions.mdx)
- [GitHub](./github.mdx)
- [GitLab CI](./gitlab.mdx)
- [Jenkins](./jenkins.mdx)
- [Tekton](./tekton.mdx)

## Container Runtimes

Dagger supports various container runtimes, allowing you to run your workflows in different environments. This includes support for Docker, Kubernetes, and other container orchestration platforms.

- [Kubernetes](../reference/container-runtimes/kubernetes.mdx)
- [Nerdctl](../reference/container-runtimes/nerdctl.mdx)
- [OpenShift](../reference/container-runtimes/openshift.mdx)
- [Podman](../reference/container-runtimes/podman.mdx)
- [Apple's Container](../reference/container-runtimes/apple-container.mdx)

## LLM Integrations

Dagger can be integrated with large language models (LLMs) to enhance your workflows with AI capabilities. This allows you to leverage LLMs for tasks such as code generation, natural language processing, and more.
