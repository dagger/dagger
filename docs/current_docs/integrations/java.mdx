# Java

Dagger can be used to perform common CI tasks - testing, containerizing, publishing and more - for any Java application. Java developers can leverage an excellent Java module from the [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/jcsirot/daggerverse/java) which provides various Dagger Functions to work with Java projects. These Dagger Functions make it easy to configure the Java/Maven versions to use, the Maven sub-commands for building and packaging the application, and the output target.

## How it works

The integration depends on the [`java` Dagger module](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/jcsirot/daggerverse/java) and is currently supported from SDKs that support Dagger modules and Functions.

To Daggerize a Java project using this integration, you must:

- Create a new Dagger module in your Java project
- Install the `java` Dagger module as a dependency
- Implement your CI pipeline as one or more Dagger Function(s)
- Test your Dagger Function(s) locally and then transfer them to your CI environment

## Prerequisites

- The [`java` Dagger module](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/jcsirot/daggerverse/java)

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to build and publish a Java application using this integration. It assumes:

- A Spring Boot Web application with Maven for dependency management. This example uses the [Spring Petclinic application](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic).
- Credentials to publish the containerized application image to a registry like Docker Hub.

Clone the application repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
```

:::warning
The code sample above is illustrative only. Modify it to your application's specific requirements.
:::

Here is an example of calling the Dagger Function to publish the application image to Docker Hub. Replace the `DOCKER-HUB-USERNAME` and `DOCKER-HUB-PASSWORD` placeholders with your Docker Hub credentials.

```shell
export REGISTRY_PASSWORD=DOCKER-HUB-PASSWORD
dagger call publish \
  --source=. \
  --version=0.1 \
  --registry-address=docker.io \
  --registry-username=DOCKER-HUB-USERNAME \
  --registry-password=env:REGISTRY_PASSWORD \
  --image-name=my-java-app
```

:::note
Java developers can also create application delivery pipelines with the experimental Java SDK, using the same language and tooling they use for their Java applications, and benefiting from faster local runs by using Dagger to cache Maven dependencies. This SDK is currently under development and therefore not yet documented.

## About Java

[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is an object-oriented programming language. Java applications are highly portable and can run on any platform for which a Java runtime environment (JRE) is available.
