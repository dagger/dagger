# Jenkins

Dagger provides a programmable container engine that allows you to replace your Groovy-based Jenkins pipelines with a regular programming language. This allows you to execute your pipeline the same locally and in Jenkins, with intelligent caching, while keeping all of your existing Jenkins infrastructure.

# How it Works

There are many ways to run Dagger on Jenkins. The simplest way to get started is having a Jenkins agent with OCI compatible container runtime.

The general workflow looks like this:

1. Jenkins receives job trigger as usual
1. Jenkins loads `Jenkinsfile` from repo or from UI config
1. Jenkins parses the Groovy based `Jenkinsfile` and finds `dagger call $foo`
1. Jenkins executes `dagger call $foo`
1. Dagger CLI attempts to find an existing Dagger Engine or spins up a new one inside the Jenkins agent.
1. Dagger Engine executes the pipeline called in `dagger call $foo` and sends telemetry to Dagger Cloud if the `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable is set.
1. Job completes with success or failure, pipeline logs appear in Jenkins as usual

# Prerequisites

Running the examples shown below requires:

1. At least one Jenkins agent with the `dagger` label
1. A Docker host (can be `docker:dind`)
1. The `docker` client installed on your Jenkins agent

# Examples

The following code sample demonstrates how to integrate Dagger with Jenkins.
