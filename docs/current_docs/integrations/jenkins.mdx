# Jenkins

The following code sample demonstrates how to integrate Dagger with Jenkins.

This requires `docker` client installed on your Jenkins agent, a Docker host available (can be `docker:dind`), and agents labeled in Jenkins with `dagger`.

```groovy title="Jenkinsfile" file=./snippets/Jenkinsfile
```

:::info 

Jenkins needs to send information about the current branch name to fully 
integrate with Dagger Cloud. [Follow these instructions to configure Jekins.](/manuals/user/cloud-get-started/?ci=Jenkins#connect-from-your-ci-engine)
