# Nerdctl

Dagger can be used with any OCI-compatible container runtime, including `nerdctl`.

## How it works

By default, Dagger tries to invoke the `docker` executable. Since `nerdctl` is CLI-compatible with Docker, it can be used as a drop-in replacement. This is as simple as creating a symbolic link to the `nerdctl` executable in your system path and naming it `docker`.

## Prerequisites

- `nerdctl` installed and running on the host system in [rootless mode](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/blob/main/docs/rootless.md).

## Example

- To use `nerdctl` with Dagger, create a symbolic link as below:

    ```shell
    sudo ln -s $(which nerdctl) /usr/local/bin/docker
    ```

- To use `nerdctl` with Dagger via `lima`, create the following shell script at `/usr/local/bin/nerdctl`:

    ```shell
    #!/bin/sh
    lima nerdctl "$@"
    ```

    Then, create a symbolic link to the shell script and name it `docker`:

    ```shell
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/nerdctl /usr/local/bin/docker
    ```
