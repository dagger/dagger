# OpenShift

Dagger can be used to set up a Continuous Integration (CI) environment on an OpenShift cluster. This makes it possible to distribute CI workloads across multiple nodes and scale out as needed.

## How it works

The architecture consists of a Dagger Engine DaemonSet which executes the pipelines and tainted nodes for dedicated workloads.

Dagger provides a Helm chart to create a Dagger Engine DaemonSet. The DaemonSet ensures that all matching nodes in the cluster run an instance of Dagger.

The Dagger DaemonSet configuration is designed to:

- best utilize local Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) hard drives of the worker nodes
- reduce the amount of network latency and bandwidth requirements
- simplify routing of Dagger SDK and CLI requests

## Prerequisites

- A functional OpenShift cluster.
- The [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager installed on your local machine.
- The [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html) (`oc`) installed on your local machine.

## Example

Create a `values.yaml` file to configure the Dagger Helm deployment. This includes a set of labels for the pod affinity and the taints and tolerations for the nodes.

```yaml file=./snippets/openshift.yaml
```

This configuration uses the label `dagger-node=true` to taint the nodes on which the Dagger Engine should be deployed.

Next, execute the following command for each node that is intended to host a Dagger Engine (replace the `NODE-NAME` placeholder with each node name):

```shell
oc adm taint nodes NODE-NAME dagger-node=true:NoSchedule
```

Install Dagger using the Dagger Helm chart and the configuration above:

```shell
helm upgrade --create-namespace --install --namespace dagger dagger oci://registry.dagger.io/dagger-helm -f values.yaml
```

Finally, grant the necessary permissions for the `default` service account in the `dagger` namespace:

:::warning
Without this step, pod creation will fail due to insufficient permissions to execute privileged containers with fixed user IDs and host path volume mounts.
:::

```shell
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n dagger
```
