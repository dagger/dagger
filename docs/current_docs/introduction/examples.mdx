# Examples

This page showcases real-world examples of Dagger in action, with a focus on working implementations you can study and adapt.

## Portable CI

- [cdebug](https://github.com/iximiuz/cdebug/tree/main/ci): A pipeline with `containerd` tests

- [Runme](https://github.com/runmedev/runme/tree/main/.dagger): A pipeline to test, build, and release a Go application

- [Blip](https://github.com/bliporg/blip/tree/main/dagger): A pipeline to lint, format and test a C++ application

- [Greetings API](https://github.com/kpenfound/greetings-api/tree/main/.dagger): A pipeline to lint, test, build and release a Go API service

- [Books API](https://github.com/vikram-dagger/fastapi-sample-app/tree/main/.dagger): A pipeline to test a Python API service

## Monorepos

- [Dagger](https://github.com/openmeterio/openmeter/tree/main/.dagger): Dagger's own CI pipelines, used to test, lint, build, and release multiple assets, includings the Dagger CLI, Dagger SDKs, and Dagger documentation.

- [OpenMeter](https://github.com/openmeterio/openmeter/tree/main/.dagger): A set of pipelines to test, lint, scan, publish and release multiple assets, includings SDKs, binaries, Helm charts and container images

## Agents and agentic CI

:::info
Watch a [livestream of building an AI agent with Dagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rDcyiR0wZE).
:::

- [Toy Programmer](https://github.com/shykes/toy-programmer): A simple programmer micro-agent for demonstration purposes

- [Multi-Agent Demo](https://github.com/kpenfound/agents/tree/main/multiagent-demo): A demonstration using multiple LLMs to collaboratively solve a problem

- [Go Coder](https://github.com/kpenfound/agents/tree/main/go-coder): A Go programmer agent that receives assignments from GitHub issues and creates PRs with solutions

- [Cypress Test Writer](https://github.com/jpadams/cypress-test-writer): An agent that compares two git branches for UI changes and creates Cypress tests to cover the differences

- [Dockerfile Optimizer](https://github.com/samalba/agents/tree/main/dockerfile-optimizer): An agent that analyzes Dockerfiles and suggests improvements for better efficiency, security, and best practices

- [Test Debugger](https://github.com/kpenfound/greetings-api/blob/main/DEBUGGER_AGENT.md): An agent that automatically debugs failing tests in CI

- [Technical Content Summarizer](https://github.com/jasonmccallister/technical-content-summarizer): An agent that summarizes technical content from a URL for a non-technical audience

- [SWE Agent](https://github.com/kpenfound/greetings-api/blob/main/SWE_AGENT.md): An agent that gets assigned GitHub issues and solves them with pull requests

- [Database Agent](https://github.com/jasonmccallister/database-agent): An agent that connects to an existing database and allows the user to ask plain language questions to explore and query a database.

## Cookbook

The [Dagger Cookbook](cookbook/index.mdx) contains practical code examples for common tasks:

- [Filesystem operations](cookbook/filesystems.mdx): Working with files and directories
- [Build operations](cookbook/builds.mdx): Building applications and container images
- [Agentic operations](cookbook/agents.mdx): Working with agents and environments
- [Service management](cookbook/services.mdx): Working with services and networking
- [Secret management](cookbook/secrets.mdx): Managing sensitive data securely
- [Troubleshooting](cookbook/errors.mdx): Handling and debugging errors
