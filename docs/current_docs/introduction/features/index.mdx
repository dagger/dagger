# Features

Dagger provides a comprehensive set of features for building, validating, and managing application delivery workflows. Explore the features below to learn how Dagger can improve your development and deployment processes.

:::tip Looking for Toolchains or Checks?
These fundamental concepts have been elevated to [Core Concepts](/core-concepts) for easier discovery. Check out:
- [Toolchains](/core-concepts/toolchains) - Install and use modules without writing code
- [Checks](/core-concepts/checks) - Validate commits with automated quality checks
- [Functions](/core-concepts/functions) - Building blocks of Dagger workflows
:::

## Core Features

### [Programmable Workflows](./programmability.mdx)
Write workflows in code, not YAML. Use your favorite programming language to build delivery pipelines with full type safety and IDE support.

### [Caching](./caching.mdx)
Automatic, intelligent caching of operations and artifacts. Dagger caches everything by default, dramatically speeding up workflow execution.

### [Sandboxed Runtime](./sandbox.mdx)
Security-first design with fully sandboxed execution. All Dagger Functions run in isolated containers without direct access to the host system.

### [Observability](./observability.mdx)
Visualize workflows in real-time with interactive terminal output and comprehensive tracing. Understand exactly what's happening at every step.

## Composition & Reusability

### [Reusability](./reusability.mdx)
Create, reuse, and share frequently-used workflows as Dagger modules. Build once, use everywhere across teams and projects.

### [Ephemeral Services](./services.mdx)
Create service containers at run-time for testing and development. Spin up databases, caches, and other services on-demand.

## Advanced Capabilities

### [LLM Integration](./llm.mdx)
Build powerful AI agents with Large Language Models. Integrate LLMs into your workflows with native support for tool use and Model Context Protocol.

### [Interactive Shell](./shell.mdx)
Iterate faster with familiar Bash-like syntax and autocomplete. Explore and test workflows interactively before committing to code.

### [Secrets Integration](./secrets.mdx)
Built-in support for secrets with multiple providers. Securely inject sensitive data into your workflows without exposing it in logs or cache.
