Dagger is built to protect your host environment by default. All Dagger Functions are fully "sandboxed" and do not have direct access to the host system.

This means that Dagger Functions cannot access host resources - such as the host environment, host services, host filesystem, or host SSH agent - unless you explicitly grant permission by passing them as arguments.

Daggerâ€™s security model treats the top-level module (i.e., the main function or highest-level call) as the single place where sensitive resources are introduced. It is only through this call that a user can explicitly provide directories, services, sockets, or secrets. In turn, the top-level module may pass these resources to other installed modules if needed, but there is never any implicit sharing.

:::important
By requiring typed arguments such as `Directory`, `Socket`, `Service`, or `Secret`, Dagger ensures users understand exactly what they are sharing with a Dagger Function. This explicit access design helps prevent malicious or untrusted modules from inadvertently obtaining sensitive data.
