# Directory

:::note
The fields listed on this page are indicative and not exhaustive. For a complete list of fields, refer to the Dagger API reference guide.
:::

The `Directory` type represents the state of a directory. This could be either a local directory path or a remote Git reference(in the latter case, Dagger will convert it to a `Directory` referencing the contents of that Git repository). Some of its important fields are:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `dockerBuild` | Builds a new Docker container from the directory |
| `entries` | Returns a list of files and directories in the directory |
| `export` | Writes the contents of the directory to a path on the host |
| `file` | Returns a file at the given path as a `File`  |
| `withFile` / `withFiles` | Returns the directory plus the file(s) copied to the given path |

Here is an example of listing the contents of the `/usr` directory in an `alpine` container:

```graphql
query {
  container {
    from(address: "alpine") {
      directory(path: "/usr") {
        entries
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here is an example of exporting the contents of the `/etc/crontabs` directory from an `alpine` container to the `/tmp` directory on the host:

```graphql
query {
  container {
    from(address: "alpine") {
      directory(path: "/etc/crontabs/") {
        export(path: "/tmp")
      }
    }
  }
}
```
