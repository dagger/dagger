# File

:::note
The fields listed on this page are indicative and not exhaustive. For a complete list of fields, refer to the Dagger API reference guide.
:::

The `File` type represents a single file. Some of its important fields are:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `contents` | Returns the contents of the file |
| `export` | Writes the file to a path on the host |


Here is an example of returning the contents of the `/etc/os-release` file from an `alpine` container:

```graphql
query {
  container {
    from(address: "alpine") {
      file(path: "/etc/os-release") {
        contents
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here is an example of copying the `/etc/os-release` file from an `alpine` container to `/tmp/outfile` on the host:

```graphql
query {
  container {
    from(address: "alpine") {
      file(path: "/etc/os-release") {
        export(path: "/tmp/outfile")
      }
    }
  }
}
```
