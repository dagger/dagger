# Basic Usage

The Dagger CLI is available for [installation](../../install.mdx) on macOS, Linux, and Windows to run locally or in a CI environment.

:::note
The commands listed on this page are not exhaustive. For a complete list of available commands, refer to the [Dagger CLI reference](../../reference/cli.mdx).
:::

## List Dagger Functions

To list the Dagger Functions available in a Dagger module, use `dagger functions`. Modules may be installed locally or hosted externally, in remote Git repositories.

Use the following command to list Dagger Functions in a local module:

```shell
dagger functions
```

Use the following command to list Dagger Functions in an external module (replace the example URL with the path to your Dagger module):

```shell
dagger -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy@v0.5.0 functions
```

## Call a Dagger Function

To invoke a Dagger Function, use `dagger call`. Here is an example of calling a local Dagger Function:

```shell
dagger call container-echo --string-arg="Welcome to Dagger!" stdout
```

Here is an example of calling a Dagger Function hosted externally:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy@v0.5.0 call scan-image --image-ref=ubuntu:latest
```

:::tip
When using `dagger call`, all names (functions, arguments, struct fields, etc) are converted into a shell-friendly "kebab-case" style.
:::

## List available arguments for a Dagger Function

To list all the arguments accepted by a function, add the `--help` suffix at any point in the `dagger call` command to obtain context-sensitive help.

Here is an example of listing the available arguments for a Dagger Function hosted externally:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy@v0.5.0 call scan-image --help
```

## Check the current Dagger versions

To obtain the current Dagger version, use `dagger version`.

```shell
dagger version
```

## Obtain command help

To see a list of available Dagger CLI commands, use `dagger help`. Command-specific help can be obtained with `dagger COMMAND --help`.

```shell
dagger help
dagger call --help
```
