# Dagger CLI

The Dagger Command-Line Interface (CLI) is your primary entrypoint to Dagger. It is a full-featured, easy to use tool that can be used interactively from a terminal or non-interactively from a shell script or a CI runner. It is available for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

The Dagger CLI provides an interface to:

- List and inspect Dagger Functions in a Dagger module
- Call one or more Dagger Functions
- Initialize a local Dagger module for development
- Send API queries to the Dagger Engine
- Run a command in a Dagger session
- Log in and out of Dagger Cloud
