# Runs and Changes

:::warning
The Runs and Changes views only apply to pipeline runs with Dagger versions older than 0.11.0. These views have been replaced by the new Traces feature in Dagger Cloud.
:::

The **All Runs** page lists runs you've triggered from your local development host and in CI. You should see your most recent run as the first entry in the table, as shown below:

A run represents one invocation of a Dagger pipeline. It contains detailed information about the steps performed by the pipeline.

The **All Runs** page provides an overview of all runs. Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each run.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status | Indication of run success or failure |
|Title | Title of the pull request or Change or commit title (abbreviated) |
|Commit |Git commit ID |
|Change | Reference to the pull request or merge request your in source code repository |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |
|User | User triggering the run |
|Runner Job | Run ID (first 8 identifying bytes) |
|Branch | Name of the branch in source code repository |
|Remote | Full path to the remote source code repository |

:::tip
You can display a subset of runs, such as runs related to a specific commit, branch, user or remote, by clicking the *Filter* icon in the corresponding field of the run list.

You can drill down into the details of a specific run by clicking it. This directs you to a run-specific **Run Details** page, as shown below. When you run Dagger locally, this is the page you visit when you click the Dagger Cloud link in the CLI output.

The **Run Details** page includes detailed status and duration metadata about the pipeline steps. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and steps within those pipelines. If there are any errors in the run, Dagger Cloud automatically brings you to the first error in the list. You see detailed logs and output of each step, making it easy for you to debug your pipelines and collaborate with your teammates.

When the run is performed in a Git context, the Dagger Cloud UI shows the VCS Git metadata associated with the commit.

When the run takes place outside of a Git context, Dagger Cloud will show the same detailed steps. However, the top-level metadata will not be populated.

Clicking into a specific step will open a drawer with several elements that can help you debug why your pipeline is failing and help you identify why a step might not have been cached.

A Change is a group of runs for a specific commit or pull/merge request. The **All Changes** page lists available groups.

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each Change.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status | Indication of run success or failure |
|Title | Change or commit title (abbreviated) |
|Commit | Commit ID |
|Change | Reference to change in source code repository |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |
|User | User triggering the run |
|Runner Job | Run ID (first 8 identifying bytes) |
|Branch | Name of the branch in source code repository |
|Remote | Full path to the remote source code repository |

You can drill down into the details of a specific change by clicking it. This directs you to a **Change Details** page, as shown below:

![View change details](/img/current_docs/manual/cloud/cloud-change-details.png)

The **Change Details** page lists all the pipeline runs for the commit or pull request. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and detailed logs of steps and outputs within those pipelines. Clicking into a run takes you to the run's details page.
