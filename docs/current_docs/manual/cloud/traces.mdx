# Traces

Dagger Cloud provides Traces, a browser-based interface focused on tracing and debugging Dagger pipeline runs. A Trace represents one invocation of a Dagger pipeline, run locally or in CI. It contains detailed information about the steps performed by the pipeline.

Traces provides a UI to debug what went wrong when something fails, focusing on tracing what happened and when it happened. Traces also helps you optimize your Dagger Functions as you author them, by giving you the detailed step-by-step execution of your pipeline and the associated telemetry. This is equally useful for debugging pipelines running on a developer's local environment as it is for pipelines in CI.

:::note
Traces is still under development and is in beta. We welcome your feedback on how we can improve this page. Please join the [Dagger Discord](https://discord.gg/dagger-io) to join the Dagger community and share your feedback.

The **Traces** page of the Dagger Cloud dashboard lists runs you've triggered from your local development host or in CI. You should see your most recent Dagger pipeline run as the first entry in the list, as shown below:

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each Trace.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status icon | Indication of the runs status: in progress, succeeded, or failed |
|Command | The exact command used to invoke your pipeline |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |

:::info
The Traces feature does not yet include metadata for the user, branch, remote, or commit. We are working on adding this metadata.

You can drill down into the details of a specific run by clicking it. This directs you to a **Trace Details** page, as shown below:

The **Trace Details** page includes detailed status and duration metadata about the pipeline steps. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and steps within those pipelines. If there are any errors in the run, Dagger Cloud automatically brings you to the first error in the list. You see detailed logs and output of each step, making it easy for you to debug your pipelines and collaborate with your teammates.

A Dagger Trace shows a detailed timeline for operations completed in a pipeline run. Dagger Cloud also applies unique IDs and icons for related operations, which are essential for debugging your pipeline when something does wrong.
