# Component Overview

Dagger consists of a number of components, all of which work together in an integrated fashion to orchestrate the delivery of applications to the cloud from start to finish.

## Dagger API
The Dagger API is a unified interface for programming the Dagger Engine. It provides a set of powerful core types for creating and managing application delivery pipelines, including types for containers, artifacts, network services, and secrets. It  uses GraphQL as its low-level language-agnostic framework, and can be accessed using any standard GraphQL client. In practice, interacting with the API directly is optional; typically, you will use a Dagger Function created with a type-safe Dagger SDK, or the Dagger CLI.

## Dagger SDKs
Dagger SDKs contain language-native code bindings for the Dagger API, enabling you to develop Dagger Functions in your preferred programming language. Dagger SDKs are currently available for Go, TypeScript and Python. Support for other languages is available via experimental, community-developed SDKs.

## Dagger Functions
Dagger Functions are the fundamental unit of computing in Dagger. Dagger Functions are regular program code, written using a Dagger SDK. With Dagger Functions, you can encapsulate common project operations or workflows, such as "pull a container image", "copy a file", and "forward a TCP port", into portable, resuable components with clear inputs and outputs. Dagger Functions execute within containers spawned by the Dagger Engine and can be called using the Dagger CLI. Dagger Functions are packaged, shared and reused in modules.

:::note
Dagger Functions are portable and interoperable across languages. For example, a Python function can call a Go function, which can call a TypeScript function, and so on. Dagger is able to do this by "translating" each Dagger Function into GraphQL at runtime and adding it to the Dagger API, thereby making it immediately usable from any other Dagger SDK or any HTTP client. This means that you no longer need to care which language your tooling is written in; you can use the one that you're most comfortable with or that best suits your requirements.

## Dagger CLI
The simplest and most common way to call Dagger Functions is with the Dagger Command-Line Interface (CLI). The Dagger CLI is a full-featured, easy to use tool that can be used interactively from a terminal or non-interactively from a shell script or a CI runner. The Dagger CLI also includes a real-time visualization feature called the terminal UI (TUI).

## Dagger Engine
The Dagger Engine is a next-generation container engine controlled by the Dagger API. FIXME

## Daggerverse
The Daggerverse is a free service run by Dagger, which indexes all publicly available Dagger Functions, and lets you easily search and consume them.

## Dagger Cloud
Dagger Cloud complements Dagger with a production-grade control plane. Features of Dagger Cloud include pipeline visualization, operational insights, and distributed caching.
