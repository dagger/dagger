# Structure and Packaging

## Module layout

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

You can split your Dagger module into multiple files, not just `main.go`. To do this, you can just create another file beside `main.go` (for example, `utils.go`):

```
.
├── dagger
│   ├── ...
|   ├── internal
│   └── ...
│   ├── main.go
│   └── utils.go
└── dagger.json
```

This file should be inside the same package as `main.go`, and as such, can access any private variables/functions/types inside the package.

Additionally, you can also split your Dagger module into Go subpackages (for example, `utils`):

```
.
├── dagger
│   ├── ...
|   ├── internal
│   └── ...
│   ├── main.go
|   └── utils
│       └── utils.go
└── dagger.json
```

Because this is a separate package, you can only use the variables/functions/types that are exported from this package in `main.go` (you can't access types from `main.go` in the `utils` package).

:::note
Only types and functions in the top-level package are part of the public-facing API for the module.
:::

You can access other Dagger types from a sub-package by importing the generated sub-package `dagger/<module>/internal/dagger`:

```go
// utils/utils.go

import "dagger/<module>/internal/dagger"

func DoThing(client *dagger.Client) *dagger.Directory {
    // we need to pass *dagger.Client in here, since we don't have access to `dag`
	...
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

```
.
├── pyproject.toml
├── uv.lock
├── sdk
└── src
│   └── main
│       └── __init__.py
└── dagger.json
```

In this structure:

- `dagger.json` is the Dagger module configuration file.
- `pyproject.toml` manages the Python project configuration.
- `uv.lock` manages the module dependencies.
- `src/main/` is where your Dagger module code goes.
- `sdk/` contains the vendored Python SDK [client library](https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/).

:::info
Placing the source code under a `src` directory follows a common Python convention. To know more, see [src layout vs flat layout](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/).
:::

The Dagger module's code in Python can be split into multiple files by making `main` a [package](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages), and ensuring the *main object* is imported in `__init__.py`. All the other object types should already be imported from there.

Tools like [build](https://build.pypa.io/en/latest/), [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/), and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) already detect the default project layout by default, but it's not required and can be overridden as long as `main` is installed correctly in `site-packages`, or is at least importable with `import main`.

For example:

```python
# src/main/__init__.py
"""My very own Dagger module"""
from .main import MyModule as MyModule

# src/main/main.py
import dagger

from .test import Test  # in src/main/test.py
from .lint import Lint  # in src/main/lint.py

@dagger.object_type
class MyModule:
    @dagger.function
    def test(self) -> Test:
        return Test()

    @dagger.function
    def lint(self) -> Lint:
        return Lint()
```

:::important
Dagger expects that a Python Dagger module is structured like a [library](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#libraries), currently hardcoded with the name `main` (temporary limitation), so that the SDK is able to load the code with:

```python
import main
```

But it's up to the Python [build system](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/#build-systems) to know where files are located in order to build and install the `main` package correctly.

This affords a lot of flexibility in how Daggger Python modules can be structured, and which tools are supported.
:::

The default project template follows known conventions for structuring a Python library (src layout, package name matching project name), which allows Python [build backends](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) to automatically recognize where the files are.

However, it's possible to change the project's name and file structure with a bit of extra configuration, as long as the build backend correctly builds the code in a way that allows the SDK to `import main` after installation.

Here is an example of moving all the code into a single `main.py` [module](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html), resulting in the following structure:

```
.
├── main.py
├── dagger.json
├── pyproject.toml
└── uv.lock
```

And corresponding `pyproject.toml` configuration:

<Tabs groupId="build-systems">
<TabItem value="hatchling">

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling>=0.15.0"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["main.py"]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="poetry-core">

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="setuptools">

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[tool.setuptools]
py-modules = ["main"]
```

### Other workflow tools

:::note
Build backends are independent from installers (or "build frontends", see [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/)), even though some installers may provide both (as separate packages). For example, [hatch](https://pypi.org/project/hatch/) vs [hatchling](https://pypi.org/project/hatchling/), [poetry](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/) vs [poetry-core](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-core/).
:::

:::tip
`dagger init` won't override existing `pyproject.toml` and `.py` files, so it's possible to use an external process to generate a different template, before calling `dagger init`.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

Due to TypeScript limitations, it is not possible to split your main class module (`index.ts`) into multiple files. However, it is possible to create sub-classes in different files and access them from your main class module:

```typescript
// src/index.ts
import { func, object } from "@dagger.io/dagger"

import { Test } from "./test" // in src/test.ts
import { Lint } from "./lint" // in src/lint.ts

@object()
class MyModule {
  @func()
  test(): Test {
    return new Test()
  }

  @func()
  lint(): Lint {
    return new Lint()
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Runtime container

Dagger modules run in a runtime container that's bootstrapped by the Dagger Engine, with the necessary environment to run the Dagger module's code.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

The runtime container is currently hardcoded to run in Go 1.21  (although this may be configurable in future).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

The runtime container is currently hardcoded to run in Python 3.11.1 using the [python:3.11-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/tags?name=3.11-slim) base image by default. This can be overridden in `pyproject.toml` since [Dagger v0.11][v11]:

```toml
[tool.dagger]
base-image = "acme/python:3.11"
```

This can be useful to add a few requirements to the module's execution environment, such as system packages like `git`.

:::warning
Don't deviate from the default base image too much or it may break in a future version of Dagger. Override at own risk.
:::

The desired interpreter version can be pinned by creating a `.python-version` file next to your `pyproject.toml`:

```console
echo "3.11" > .python-version
```

This can be useful either to pin the version in case the default one gets an upgrade, or to choose a newer version.

As an alternative, setting [`requires-python`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#python-requires) in `pyproject.toml` will also pin the version, but using a lower bound constraint (minimum version). For example, the following will use Python 3.11, even though Python 3.12 is available:

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.11"
```

Each release of Dagger bundles the Python SDK inside the Dagger Engine container image. During the Dagger module's code generation phase, that directory is unpacked and installed automatically, including dependencies. That directory is the same one that is exported to the host as `./sdk` when running `dagger init --sdk=python` or `dagger develop --sdk=python`. Note that it is **not** the same as the directory obtained when installing from [dagger-io](https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/).

The runtime container installs the SDK as an editable install, similar to the following:

```shell
# executed by the runtime container
uv pip install -e ./sdk
```

This is why the initial `pyproject.toml` file doesn't include any [dependencies](./language-dependencies.mdx).

### UV installer

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is used internally to create the virtual environment, install dependencies and create the [lock file](./language-dependencies.mdx#lock-file) (starting with Dagger v0.11.0). It's possible to specify a newer version, if needed, in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.dagger]
uv-version = "0.1.30"
```

If `pip` is required instead, `uv` can be disabled:

```toml
[tool.dagger]
use-uv = false
```

Note, however, that [pinning](./language-dependencies.mdx#lock-file) via `requirements.lock` is only supported with `uv`.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

The runtime container is currently hardcoded to run in Node.js 21.3 (although this may be configurable in future).

[Bun](https://bun.sh/) is experimentally supported and [work is in progress](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/4368) to support [Deno](https://deno.com/).

The TypeScript SDK is installed automatically, including dependencies, with a version that's tied to the currently running Dagger Engine container:

```shell
# executed by the runtime container
yarn install
npm pkg set "dependencies[@dagger.io/dagger]=./sdk"
```

The SDK files are mounted under `/sdk` in the Dagger Engine runtime container.

This is why the initial `package.json` doesn't include any dependencies except a local link to the `sdk` generated directory.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.3.2"
    "@dagger.io/dagger": "./sdk"
  }
}
```

## Language-native packaging

The structure of a Dagger module mimics that of each language's conventional packaging mechanisms and tools.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

Dagger modules written for use with the Go SDK are automatically created as [Go modules](https://go.dev/ref/mod). At module creation time, a `go.mod` and `go.sum` file will automatically be created  that import the necessary dependencies. Dependencies can be installed and managed just as for any standard Go environment.

After using new dependencies in your code, update your `go.mod`/`go.sum` with the newly imported dependencies by using [`go mod tidy`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-tidy).

### Go workspaces

Since it's common to have a sub-directory inside your main project containing your Dagger module code, you can manage your modules using [Go workspaces](https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces).

When a new Dagger module is created, Dagger attempts to add it to a root `go.work` if it exists. If not, it can be added manually later with `go work use ./path/to/mymodule`.

```go
// go.work
go 1.21.7

use (
	./path/to/mymodule
)
```

### Go vendor

[Go vendor](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-vendor) directories are not currently supported. See [https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/6076](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/6076) for more information.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

Dagger modules in Python are built to be installed, like libraries. At module creation time, a `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` file will automatically be created that depend on the locally generated client library (in `./sdk`). This dependency is configured to be editable so that changes in the code don't require a re-install.

With the `uv.lock` file, Dagger uses uv's [project management](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/) capabilites, but it can be opted out by removing this file, in which case Dagger falls back to [the pip interface](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/) instead.

:::info
Dagger also supports pinning dependencies with a `pip-tools` compatible `requirements.lock` file in order to support the use of other project managers like Poetry or Hatch locally (when developing).

In this case, Dagger installs dependencies with:

```shell
# executed by the runtime
uv pip install -r requirements.lock -e ./sdk -e .
```

Notice that the `./sdk` and `main` (in `.`) packages don't need to be in the `requirements.lock` file, only the third party dependencies.

This means module developers can use any tool they want to manage their virtual environment and install dependencies, but if third-party dependencies aren't pinned in a `requirements.lock` file, the developers may get different versions between the Dagger execution environment and their own local environment.

For example, Poetry has its own `poetry.lock` which Dagger doesn't recognize, but it can be exported as a `requirements.lock` file with:

```shell
poetry export --without main -o requirements.lock
```

It will have to be manually kept in sync, though.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">
Dagger modules in Typescript are built to be installed, like libraries. The runtime container installs the module code with:

```shell
# executed by the runtime container
yarn install --production
```

This means that so long as the project has a `package.json` file, it can be used as a library and it can be managed using any Node.js package manager such as [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/), [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) or [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Only production dependencies are installed, not packages defined in the `devDependencies` field.
