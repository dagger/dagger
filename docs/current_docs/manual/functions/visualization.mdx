# Visualization

Dagger works by building up a DAG of operations and evaluating them, often in parallel. By nature, this is a difficult thing to display. It's easy to show the output of one operation at a time, but as soon as you have parallelism, you'll get jumbled output that's hard to understand.

This quickly creates the need to visualize the pipeline, to understand what's going on. The Dagger CLI and Dagger Cloud both provide tools for this purpose.

## Dagger CLI

The Dagger CLI includes a real-time visualization feature called the terminal UI (TUI).

The Dagger CLI includes a real-time visualization feature, also called the terminal UI (TUI). It shows a full-blown DAG in a style similar to `git log --graph`, with the current state of your DAG's evaluation and a full snapshot of all output at the end.

The TUI is designed for rapid iteration, in the same way regular scripting works: you run a command, it shows live progress, and then leaves all the output in your terminal scrollback. Here is an example of it in action:

![Dagger TUI](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/tui.gif)

The TUI is driven by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and is essentially a live-streaming OpenTelemetry trace visualizer. It represents Dagger API calls as OpenTelemetry spans with special metadata. If user code integrates with OpenTelemetry, related spans will appear in the TUI as first-class citizens.

The TUI renders a tree of Dagger API calls, represented as GraphQL queries. A parent-child relationship means that the child call is being made by the parent call.
- A red X or green check indicates whether the call succeeded or failed.
- A call's duration is rendered after its name.

The CLI has tiered verbosity: `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv` (just like `curl`):
- `-v` keeps spans visible after they complete, rather than disappearing after a brief pause;
- `-vv` reveals internal and encapsulated spans;
- `-vvv` reveals sub-100ms spans.

For additional debugging information, add the `--debug` flag to the `dagger call` command.

## Dagger Cloud

### Traces

Dagger Cloud provides Traces, a browser-based interface focused on tracing and debugging Dagger pipeline runs. A Trace represents one invocation of a Dagger pipeline, run locally or in CI. It contains detailed information about the steps performed by the pipeline.

Traces provides a UI to debug what went wrong when something fails, focusing on tracing what happened and when it happened. Traces also helps you optimize your Dagger Functions as you author them, by giving you the detailed step-by-step execution of your pipeline and the associated telemetry. This is equally useful for debugging pipelines running on a developerâ€™s local environment as it is for pipelines in CI.

:::note
Traces is still under development and is in beta. We welcome your feedback on how we can improve this page. Please join the [Dagger Discord](https://discord.gg/dagger-io) to join the Dagger community and share your feedback.
:::

The **Traces** page of the Dagger Cloud dashboard lists runs you've triggered from your local development host or in CI. You should see your most recent Dagger pipeline run as the first entry in the list, as shown below:

![View Traces](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/cloud-view-traces.png)

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each Trace.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status icon | Indication of the runs status: in progress, succeeded, or failed |
|Command | The exact command used to invoke your pipeline |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |

:::info
The Traces feature does not yet include metadata for the user, branch, remote, or commit. We are working on adding this metadata.
:::

You can drill down into the details of a specific run by clicking it. This directs you to a **Trace Details** page, as shown below:

![View Trace Details](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/cloud-view-trace-details.png)

The **Trace Details** page includes detailed status and duration metadata about the pipeline steps. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and steps within those pipelines. If there are any errors in the run, Dagger Cloud automatically brings you to the first error in the list. You see detailed logs and output of each step, making it easy for you to debug your pipelines and collaborate with your teammates.

A Dagger Trace shows a detailed timeline for operations completed in a pipeline run. Dagger Cloud also applies unique IDs and icons for related operations, which are essential for debugging your pipeline when something does wrong.

### Runs and Changes

:::warning
The Runs and Changes views only apply to pipeline runs with Dagger versions older than 0.11.0. These views have been replaced by the new Traces feature in Dagger Cloud.
:::

The **All Runs** page lists runs you've triggered from your local development host and in CI. You should see your most recent run as the first entry in the table, as shown below:

![View runs](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/cloud-view-runs.png)

A run represents one invocation of a Dagger pipeline. It contains detailed information about the steps performed by the pipeline.

The **All Runs** page provides an overview of all runs. Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each run.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status | Indication of run success or failure |
|Title | Title of the pull request or Change or commit title (abbreviated) |
|Commit |Git commit ID |
|Change | Reference to the pull request or merge request your in source code repository |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |
|User | User triggering the run |
|Runner Job | Run ID (first 8 identifying bytes) |
|Branch | Name of the branch in source code repository |
|Remote | Full path to the remote source code repository |

:::tip
You can display a subset of runs, such as runs related to a specific commit, branch, user or remote, by clicking the *Filter* icon in the corresponding field of the run list.
:::

You can drill down into the details of a specific run by clicking it. This directs you to a run-specific **Run Details** page, as shown below. When you run Dagger locally, this is the page you visit when you click the Dagger Cloud link in the CLI output.

![View run details](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/cloud-view-run-details-tree.png)

The **Run Details** page includes detailed status and duration metadata about the pipeline steps. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and steps within those pipelines. If there are any errors in the run, Dagger Cloud automatically brings you to the first error in the list. You see detailed logs and output of each step, making it easy for you to debug your pipelines and collaborate with your teammates.

When the run is performed in a Git context, the Dagger Cloud UI shows the VCS Git metadata associated with the commit.

![Run with metadata](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/cloud-run-git-metadata.png)

When the run takes place outside of a Git context, Dagger Cloud will show the same detailed steps. However, the top-level metadata will not be populated.

![Run, no metadata](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/cloud-run-no-metadata.png)

Clicking into a specific step will open a drawer with several elements that can help you debug why your pipeline is failing and help you identify why a step might not have been cached.

![View step details](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/cloud-step-details.png)

A Change is a group of runs for a specific commit or pull/merge request. The **All Changes** page lists available groups.

![View changes](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/cloud-all-changes.png)

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each Change.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status | Indication of run success or failure |
|Title | Change or commit title (abbreviated) |
|Commit | Commit ID |
|Change | Reference to change in source code repository |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |
|User | User triggering the run |
|Runner Job | Run ID (first 8 identifying bytes) |
|Branch | Name of the branch in source code repository |
|Remote | Full path to the remote source code repository |

You can drill down into the details of a specific change by clicking it. This directs you to a **Change Details** page, as shown below:

![View change details](/img/current_docs/manual/functions/cloud-change-details.png)

The **Change Details** page lists all the pipeline runs for the commit or pull request. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and detailed logs of steps and outputs within those pipelines. Clicking into a run takes you to the run's details page.
