# Manual

Welcome to the Dagger manual!

This manual provides detailed information to help you use Dagger. It covers:

- The Dagger CLI, your primary entrypoint to Dagger;
- Dagger Functions, which let you encapsulate tasks and workflows into software components which can be loaded into any Dagger Engine, and called by other Dagger Functions;
- The Dagger API, which provides primitives to stitch together powerful pipelines out of containers, artifacts, network services, and secrets â€“ all in type-safe Go, Python or TypeScript;
- The Dagger Engine, a container engine controlled by the Dagger API;
- Dagger Cloud, which provides additional visualization and debugging features;
- The Daggerverse, a free service run by Dagger to easily search and consume Dagger Functions.
