# Roles and Permissions

In Dagger Cloud, users can have one of two roles: *Admin* or *Member*. The Admin role is not a superset of the Member role. If a user needs to administer an organization and view Dagger pipeline runs, ensure that the user also has the Member role.

| Actions | Admin | Member |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| View Dagger pipeline runs and changes |  | ✓ |
| View members of an org | ✓ | ✓ |
| Invite new members to an org | ✓ |  |
| Delete an existing member from an org | ✓ |  |

You cannot change a member's role at this time. Please contact Dagger via the support messenger in Dagger Cloud if you need assistance. We're adding this functionality soon.
