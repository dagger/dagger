# Use a Custom Runner

A runner is the "backend" of the Dagger Engine where containers are actually executed.

Runners are responsible for:

- Executing containers specified by functions
- Pulling container images, Git repos and other sources needed for function execution
- Pushing container images to registries
- Managing the cache backing function execution

The runner is distributed as a container image, making it easy to run on various container runtimes like Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, etc.

The consolidated steps to use a custom runner are:

- Determine the runner version required by checking the release notes of the CLI or SDK you intend to use.
- If changes to the base image are needed, make those and push them to a registry. If no changes are needed, just use it as is.
- Start the runner image in your target of choice, [requirements](#execution-requirements) and [configuration](#configuration) in mind.
- Export the `_EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST` environment variable with a [a value pointing to your target](#connection-interface).
- Call `dagger call` or execute SDK code directly with that environment variable set.

:::note
The `_EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST` variable is experimental and may change in future.

## Distribution and Versioning

The runner is distributed as a container image at `registry.dagger.io/engine`.

- Tags are made for the version of each release.
- For example, the [`v0.10.2` release](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/releases/tag/v0.10.2) has a corresponding image at `registry.dagger.io/engine:v0.10.2`

## Execution Requirements

1. The runner container currently needs root capabilities, including among others `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, in order to execute pipelines. For example, this will be granted when using the `--privileged` flag of `docker run`.
1. The runner container should be given a volume at `/var/lib/dagger`.
    - Otherwise runner execution may be extremely slow. This is due to the fact that it relies on overlayfs mounts for efficient operation, which isn't possible when `/var/lib/dagger` is itself an overlayfs.
    - For example, this can be provided to a `docker run` command as `-v dagger-engine:/var/lib/dagger`.
1. The container image comes with a default entrypoint which should be used to start the runner; no extra arguments are needed.
1. The container image comes with a default config file at `/etc/dagger/engine.toml`
    - The `insecure-entitlements = ["security.insecure"]` setting enables use of the `InsecureRootCapabilities` flag in `WithExec`. Removing that line will result in an error when trying to use that flag.

## Configuration

### Custom CA Certs

If any extra CA certs are to be included in order to - for example - push images to a private registry, they can be included under `/etc/ssl/certs` in the runner image.

This can be accomplished by building a custom engine image using the Dagger Engine image as a base, or by mounting them into a container created from the Dagger Engine image at runtime.

### Privileged Execs

By default, the Dagger Engine allows execs to run with root capabilities when the `InsecureRootCapabilities` field is set to true in the `WithExec` API.

This can be disabled by overriding the default engine config at `/etc/dagger/engine.toml` to remove the line `insecure-entitlements = ["security.insecure"]`.

### Connection Interface

After the runner starts up, the CLI needs to connect to it. In the default situation, this will happen automatically.

However, if the `_EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST` environment variable is set, then the CLI will instead connect to the endpoint specified there. This environment variable currently accepts values in the following format:

1. `docker-container://<container name>` - Connect to the runner inside the given Docker container.
    - Requires the `docker` CLI to be present and usable. Will result in shelling out to `docker exec`.
1. `docker-image://<container image reference>` - Start the runner in Docker using the provided container image, pulling it locally if needed
    - Requires the Docker CLI to be present and usable.
1. `podman-container://<container name>` - Connect to the runner inside the given Podman container.
1. `kube-pod://<podname>?context=<context>&namespace=<namespace>&container=<container>` - Connect to the runner inside the given Kubernetes pod.
    - Query strings params like context and namespace are optional.
1. `unix://<path to unix socket>` - Connect to the runner over the provided UNIX socket.
1. `tcp://<address:port>` - Connect to the runner over TCP using the provided address and port.

:::warning
Dagger itself does not set up any encryption of data sent over the wire. It relies on the underlying connection type to implement this when needed. If you are using a connection type that does not provide encryption, then all queries and responses will be sent in plaintext over the wire from the Dagger CLI to the runner.
