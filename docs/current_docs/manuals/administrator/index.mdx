# Administrator Manual

Welcome to the Dagger administrator manual!

This manual is intended to help Dagger administrators and operators use Dagger in production environments.

It includes information on available Dagger [integrations](../../integrations/index.mdx), including for popular CI providers/tools like [GitHub](../../integrations/github.mdx), [GitLab CI](../../integrations/gitlab.mdx), and [Jenkins](../../integrations/jenkins.mdx).

It also provides information on using Dagger with [Kubernetes](../../integrations/kubernetes.mdx), and [Dagger Cloud administration](./cloud/index.mdx).
