# Containerd (nerdctl)

`nerdctl` is CLI-compatible with Docker and therefore can be used by creating a symbolic link to the `nerdctl` executable in your system path and naming it `docker`.

- To use `nerdctl` directly, create a symbolic link as below:

    ```shell
    sudo ln -s $(which nerdctl) /usr/local/bin/docker
    ```

- To use `nerdctl` via `lima`, create the following shell script at `/usr/local/bin/nerdctl`:

    ```shell
    #!/bin/sh
    lima nerdctl "$@"
    ```

    Then, create a symbolic link to the shell script and name it `docker`:

    ```shell
    sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/nerdctl /usr/local/bin/docker
    ```
