# Debugging

If you come across bugs, here are some simple debugging suggestions.

### Inspect the pipeline with the `Terminal()` method

The `Terminal()` method lets you set one or more breakpoints in your Dagger pipeline, and start an interactive terminal session at each breakpoint. This lets you interactively inspect a `Directory` or a `Container` at any point in your pipeline run.

Here is an example of a Dagger Function which opens an interactive terminal at two different points in the Dagger pipeline to inspect the built container:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

```go file=./snippets/debugging/go/terminal-container/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">
```python file=./snippets/debugging/python/terminal-container/main.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript file=./snippets/debugging/typescript/terminal-container/index.ts
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `Terminal()` method can be chained. It returns a `Container`, so it can be injected at any point in a pipeline (in this example, between `From()` and `WithExec()` methods).

:::tip
Multiple terminals are supported in the same Dagger Function; they will open in sequence.
:::

It's also possible to inspect a directory using the `Terminal()` method. Here is an example of a Dagger Function which opens an interactive terminal on a directory:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

```go file=./snippets/debugging/go/terminal-directory-1/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">
```python file=./snippets/debugging/python/terminal-directory-1/main.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript file=./snippets/debugging/typescript/terminal-directory-1/index.ts
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The container can be customized using `DirectoryTerminalOpts`. Here is a more complex Dagger Function, which does the same as the previous one but this time using an `ubuntu` container image and `bash` shell instead of the default `alpine` container image and `sh` shell.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

```go file=./snippets/debugging/go/terminal-directory-2/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">
```python file=./snippets/debugging/python/terminal-directory-2/main.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript file=./snippets/debugging/typescript/terminal-directory-2/index.ts
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Rerun commands with `--debug`

The Dagger CLI tries to keep its output concise by default. If you're running
into issues and want to debug with more detailed output, you can run any `dagger`
subcommand with the `--debug` flag to have it reveal all available information.

### Access the Dagger Engine logs

The Dagger Engine runs in a dedicated Docker container and emits log messages as it works. Here's how to access these logs:

```shell
DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER="$(docker container list --all --filter 'name=^dagger-engine-*' --format '{{.Names}}')"
docker logs $DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER
```

### Enable SDK debug logs

:::important
The information in this section is only applicable to the Python SDK. Debug logs are not currently available for the Go and TypeScript SDKs.
:::

The Python SDK prints debugging information at various steps of the execution
flow of a module, which can be very useful in understanding what's being
received from and sent to the API.

This is done using standard Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html),
so it's highly configurable (for example, saving to a file or sending to an
external system like Sentry). But for a simple lowering of the default logging
level to [logging.DEBUG](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.DEBUG),
there's a convenience function for that:

```python file=./snippets/debugging/sdk-logs/python/main.py
```

:::note
With the TUI, you need to use a progress output that doesn't collapse on success
like `--progress=plain` or `--debug`, otherwise it won't show in the terminal.
:::

Using the command `dagger call --debug echo --msg="hello"`, you should see a large number of debug messages, eventually ending with output similar to the below:

```
  ✔ connect 0.1s
✔ Debug.echo(msg: "hello"): String! 0.9s
┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._resolver: func => <Signature (msg: str) -> str>
┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._resolver: input args => {'msg': 'hello'}
┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._resolver: structured args => {'msg': 'hello'}
┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: result => 'hello'
┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: output => '"hello"'
┃ [DEBUG] dagger.client._session: Closing client session to GraphQL server

hello
```

The above gives a lot of useful information:
- The function and parent object that the API wants to execute
- The parent object's state
- The function's signature
- The user inputs before and after deserialization
- The user inputs after being converted to more complex types (structuring)
- The function's result before and after serialization
