# Enums


Dagger supports custom enumeration types, this is useful to restrict possible values for an arguments.

:::note
Following the [GraphQL specification](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#Name), enums are represented as strings in the GraphQL schema and follows the following rules:
- The value cannot start with digit and can only be composed of letter, digit or _
- Name are case sensitive, and by convention should be in screaming case

<TabItem value="Go">

Here is an example of a `trivy` Dagger module with a function named `Scan` that will take as arguments the reference of an image and a severity
defined as an enum `Severity`:

```go file=./snippets/enums/go/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

Here is an example of a `trivy` Dagger module with a function named `scan` that will take as arguments the reference of an image and a severity

:::note
Enumerations will be displayed when calling `--help` on a Dagger Function.
:::

Here's an example of displaying a Dagger Function helper on this method:

```
dagger call scan --help
```

The result will be:

```
USAGE
  dagger call scan [arguments]

ARGUMENTS
      --ref string                                  [required]
      --severity UNKNOWN,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL   [required]
```

Here's an example of calling the Dagger Function with an invalid enum argument, which will result in an error that displays
possible values:

```
dagger call scan --ref=hello-world:latest --severity=FOO
```

The result will be:

```
Error: invalid argument "FOO" for "--severity" flag: value should be one of UNKNOWN,LOW,MEDIUM,HIGH,CRITICAL
Run 'dagger call scan --help' for usage.
```
