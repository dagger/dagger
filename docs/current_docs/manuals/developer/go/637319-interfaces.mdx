# Interfaces


The Go SDK supports interfaces, which allow you to define Go-style interface
definitions so that your module can accept arbitrary values from other modules
without being tightly coupled to the concrete type underneath.

To use an interface, define a Go interface that embeds `DaggerObject` and use
it in a function argument:

```go file=./snippets/interfaces/main.go
```

Functions defined in interface definitions must match the client-side API
signature style. If they return a scalar value or an array, they must accept a
`context.Context` argument and return an `error` return value. If they return a
chainable object value, they must not return an `error` value, and they do not need
to include a `context.Context` argument.

Note that you must also provide argument names, since they directly translate
to the GraphQL field argument names.
