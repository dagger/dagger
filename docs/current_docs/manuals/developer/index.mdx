# Developer Manual


Welcome to the Dagger developer manual!

- With the *Dagger API*, you can use core primitives to stitch together powerful pipelines out of containers, artifacts, network services, and secrets â€“ all in type-safe Go, Python or TypeScript.
- With *Dagger Functions*, you can encapsulate this code into a software component which can be loaded into any Dagger Engine, and called by other functions.

Start your journey into Dagger Module development with the following resources:

- Understand the [difference between Dagger Modules and Dagger Functions](./overview/382910-modules-vs-functions.mdx)
- Learn about the [architecture](./overview/482011-architecture.mdx) and [execution environment](./overview/942201-execution-environment.mdx) for Dagger Modules
- Write your first Dagger Module in [Go](./go/525021-first-module.mdx), [Python](./python/419481-first-module.mdx) or [TypeScript](./typescript/506316-first-module.mdx)
- Read the developer documentation for [Go](./go/index.mdx), [Python](./python/index.mdx) and [TypeScript](./typescript/index.mdx)
