# Developer Manual


Welcome to the Dagger developer manual!

- With the *Dagger API*, you can use core primitives to stitch together powerful pipelines out of containers, artifacts, network services, and secrets â€“ all in type-safe Go, Python or TypeScript.
- With *Dagger Functions*, you can encapsulate this code into a software component which can be loaded into any Dagger Engine, and called by other functions.

Start your journey into Dagger module development with the following resources:

- Understand the [difference between Dagger modules and Dagger Functions](./modules-vs-functions.mdx)
- Learn about the [architecture](./architecture.mdx) and [execution environment](./execution-environment.mdx) for Dagger modules
- Add [IDE support](./ide-integration.mdx) for your Dagger Function development
- Understand Dagger Function [arguments and return values](./functions.mdx)
- Document your Dagger Function with [inline comments](./documentation.mdx)
- Work with [secrets](./secrets.mdx) and [services](./services.mdx) in Dagger Functions
- [Chain](./chaining.mdx) a Dagger Function to other Dagger Functions
- [Handle errors](./error-handling.mdx) and [debug](./debugging.mdx) your Dagger Function
