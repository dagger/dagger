# Language Dependencies

Dagger Functions are just regular code, written in your usual language. One of the key advantages of this approach is that it opens up access to your language's existing ecosystem of packages or modules. You can easily add and use these packages/modules as dependencies in your Dagger module via your language's package manager.

<TabItem value="Go">

To add a Go dependency, add it to your `go.mod` file using `go get`. For example:

```shell
go get github.com/spf13/cobra
```

<TabItem value="Python">

To add a Python dependency, [add it to `pyproject.toml`'s `dependencies`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#dependencies-and-requirements). For example:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "infisical-python>=2.1.8",
]
```

Of course, for tools that support it, you can simply use the CLI, as below:

```shell
poetry add infisical-python
```

## Lock file

While Python doesn't have a [lock file standard](https://discuss.python.org/t/lock-files-again-but-this-time-w-sdists/46593/313) yet, other than using a tool that has a proprietary format (like Poetry), the most common way to do it is with a `pip`-compatible format like [`pip-tools`](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) uses.

Since the introduction of [uv](./module-structure.mdx#uv-installer), dependencies are pinned by default using a `requirements.lock` file. If it exists, the Python SDK will use it directly to install dependencies, resulting in a faster installation.

:::tip
Check [compatibility with `pip` and `pip-tools`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/PIP_COMPATIBILITY.md) if migrating from or integrating with those tools.
:::

The lock file is only created automatically for new modules. For existing modules that don't have it, it can be created (and updated) manually. For example:

```console
uv pip compile --generate-hashes --update-all -o requirements.lock pyproject.toml sdk/pyproject.toml
```

The above command pulls in dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and `sdk/pyproject.toml`, gets their latest compatible versions, and writes them to `requirements.lock` with added hashes to verify integrity when downloading during install.

:::important
Make sure that `./sdk/pyproject.toml` is up to date first with:

```console
dagger develop
```
:::

:::note
The lock file should only include dependencies, and not the editable installs for the `./sdk` and current module.
:::

### Poetry's lock file

Dagger doesn't support running the `poetry` CLI. It depends on standards like [PEP 517](./module-structure.mdx#language-native-packaging). That means that it doesn't know about the `poetry.lock` file, but the `requirements.lock` file can be generated with [`poetry export`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli#export):

```console
poetry export --with dev --without main -o requirements.lock
```

:::important
The `dagger-io` dev dependency is [not exported correctly](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-plugin-export/issues/145), so it needs to be removed:

```console
sed -i '' '/dagger-io @/d' requirements.lock
```

<TabItem value="TypeScript">

To add a TypeScript dependency, add it to the `package.json` file using your favorite package manager. For example:

```shell
npm install pm2
```

Pinning a specific dependency version or adding local dependencies are supported, in the same way as any Node.js project.
