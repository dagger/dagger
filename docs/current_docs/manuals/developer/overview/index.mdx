Welcome to the Dagger developer manual!

This manual explains how to use the Dagger Python SDK to 1) query the Dagger API, and 2) extend it with Dagger Functions.


If you're just getting started, the pages below will give you essential information you need to begin developing Dagger Modules.

- Understand the [difference between Dagger Modules and Dagger Functions](../overview/382910-modules-vs-functions.mdx)
- Learn about the [architecture](../overview/482011-architecture.mdx) and [execution environment](../overview/942201-execution-environment.mdx) for Dagger Modules
- Read the documentation for developing Dagger Modules in one of the supported programming languages: [Go](../go/index.mdx), [Python](../python/index.mdx) or [TypeScript](../typescript/index.mdx)
- Review the [list of known issues](../829091-known-issues.mdx)
