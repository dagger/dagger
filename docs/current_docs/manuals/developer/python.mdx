# Python Extras

This page lists features specific to the Python SDK.

## module structure

### Python version

Dagger modules run in a [container](./execution-environment.mdx) that's bootstrapped specifically by the Python SDK, with the necessary environment to run the module's code. It currently runs Python 3.11 by default but, starting with [Dagger v0.11.0][v11], the version can be changed.

The desired interpreter version can be pinned by creating a `.python-version` file next to your `pyproject.toml`:

```console
echo "3.11" > .python-version
```

This can be useful either to pin the version in case the default one gets an upgrade, or to choose a newer version.

As an alternative, setting [`requires-python`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#python-requires) in `pyproject.toml` will also pin the version, but using a lower bound constraint (minimum version). For example, the following will use Python 3.11, even though Python 3.12 is available:

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.11"
```

### Base image

The default base image is [python:VERSION-slim](https://hub.docker.com/_/python/tags?name=3.11-slim) (based on the [Python version](#python-version)), but it can be overridden in `pyproject.toml` since [Dagger v0.11][v11]:

```toml
[dagger.tool]
base-image = "acme/python:3.11"
```

This can be useful to add a few requirements to the module's execution environment, such as system packages like `git`.

:::warning
Don't deviate from the default base image too much or it may break in a future version of Dagger. Override at own risk.
:::

### Automatic SDK install

Each release of Dagger bundles the Python SDK inside the Engine container image. During the Dagger module's code generation phase, that directory is unpacked and installed automatically, including dependencies. That directory is the same one that is exported to the host as `./sdk` when running `dagger init --sdk=python` or `dagger develop --sdk=python`. Note that it is **not** the same as the directory obtained when installing from [dagger-io](https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/).

The runtime container installs the SDK as an editable install, similar to the following:

```shell
# executed by the runtime container
uv pip install -e ./sdk
```

This is why the initial `pyproject.toml` file doesn't include any [dependencies](./python/077133-python-dependencies.mdx).

#### UV installer

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is used internally to create the virtual environment, install dependencies and create the [lock file](./077133-python-dependencies.mdx#lock-file) (starting with [Dagger v0.11.0][v11]). It's possible to specify a newer version, if needed, in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.dagger]
uv-version = "0.1.30"
```

If `pip` is required instead, `uv` can be disabled:

```toml
[tool.dagger]
use-uv = false
```

Note, however, that [pinning](./python/077133-python-dependencies.mdx#lock-file) via `requirements.lock` is only supported with `uv`.

### modules as Python libraries

Dagger modules in Python are built to be installed, like libraries. The runtime container installs the module code with:

```shell
# executed by the runtime
uv pip install -e .
```

Due to [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) and [`pip` supporting `pyproject.toml`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/), this means that all package managers that support the [build backend](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#declaring-the-build-backend) standard are automatically supported.

For example, you can use [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#build-system), [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#poetry-and-pep-517), or [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/reference/build/), to manage a module's dependencies and configure how it's built and installed.

Read more about this in the [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) tutorial.

#### Required `main` in `site-packages`

The module's code isn't executed directly like a script, but it is rather imported under the hardcoded name `main` (although this may be configurable in future).

This means that after `uv pip install -e .`, there should be a Python module (or package) called `main` in the virtual environment's `site-packages/` directory inside the runtime container (`/opt/venv/lib/python-3.11/site-packages/main` by default).

This is the most important requirement. The other conventions are flexible, as long as the above is verified.

### Project name

The default project name in `pyproject.toml` is also `main`:

```toml
[project]
name = "main"
```

This is because most package managers use the name of the project to find the package to build, under `./src`. So, if you change the name of the project, you also need to make sure your chosen tool can find the package.

Here is an example of using a different project name with Poetry (truncated for brevity):

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "awesome-module"
packages = [{ include = "main", from = "src" }]
```

### Default project layout

The default template from `dagger init` creates a `main` package inside a `src` directory. This follows a [Python convention](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/) that requires a project to be installed in order to run its code. This prevents accidental usage of development code since the Python interpreter includes the current working directory as the first item on the import path (more information is available in this [blog post on Python packaging](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/)).

Tools like [build](https://build.pypa.io/en/latest/), [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/), and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) already detect this project layout by default, but it's not required and can be overridden as long as `main` is installed correctly in `site-packages`, or is at least importable with `import main`.

Here is an example of moving the `main` package next to `pyproject.toml`, resulting in the following structure:

```
.
├── main
│  ├── __init__.py
│  ├── lint.py
│  └── test.py
├── dagger.json
├── pyproject.toml
└── requirements.lock
```

In this case, it is necessary to explicitly tell Poetry where to find the package, as shown below (truncated for brevity):

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "awesome-module"
packages = [{ include = "main" }]
```

### Alternative project template

If a different project layout is needed, `dagger init` won't override existing `pyproject.toml` and `.py` files. For example, to create the initial files with [Rye](https://rye-up.com):


```console
rye init --name=main acme
cd acme
dagger init --sdk=python --source=.
```

Rye will create an initial `src/main/__init__.py` but Dagger won't recognize any Dagger Functions in it. Either remove it and let Dagger create the default one, or adapt it to your needs before running `dagger call`.

### Poetry support

[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is a very popular workflow tool for Python. It doesn't fully support the [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) yet, but [it's coming](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/9135).

It does support [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) however, which makes it possible to use with Dagger. Same as in [alternative project template](#alternative-project-template), the project can be initialized with:

```console
mkdir acme
cd acme
poetry init --name main --python "^3.11"
```

Remove the `"readme"` entry in `pyproject.toml` so Dagger doesn't fail with the unknown file. Here's an example of a minimal Poetry configuration:

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "main"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
authors = []

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.11"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"
```

After `dagger init --sdk=python`, the `./sdk` can be added as a development dependency:

```console
poetry add -e --group=dev ./sdk
```

Which adds the following to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
dagger-io = {path = "sdk", develop = true}
```

### Other workflow tools

Dagger is agnostic to the tool used [in development](./python/742020-ide-integration.mdx). Similarly to Rye and Poetry, as long as the right standards are supported, Dagger should be able to use it too.

## Name overrides

Sometimes it's possible to get into a situation where the name you want to use
for the Dagger API is reserved or has a naming conflict within Python.

To resolve this, the [`@dagger.function`][@function] decorator and the
[`dagger.field`][dag-field] descriptor have a `name` argument to provide
an alternative name for the Dagger API. And for function arguments,
[annotate][Annotated] with an additional [`dagger.Arg`][dag-arg] metadata.

Here's an example with a renamed object attribute (and constructor argument),
function and function argument:

```python file=./snippets/python/name-overrides/main.py
```

Confirm with `dagger call --help` that the names were overridden:

```
FUNCTIONS
  def           Definition
  import        Import the specified image

ARGUMENTS
      --def string   Definition (default "latest")
```

And the same for the function argument, with `dagger call import --help`:

```
ARGUMENTS
      --from string   Image ref (default "alpine")
```

## Python debug logs

The Python SDK prints debugging information at various steps of the execution
flow of a module, which can be very useful in understanding what's being
received from and sent to the API.

This is done using standard Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html),
so it's highly configurable (for example, saving to a file or sending to an
external system like Sentry). But for a simple lowering of the default logging
level to [logging.DEBUG](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.DEBUG),
there's a convenience function for that:

```python file=./snippets/python/debugging/main.py
```

:::note
With the TUI, you need to use a progress output that doesn't collapse on success
like `--progress=plain` or `--debug`, otherwise it won't show in the terminal.
:::

Using the command `dagger call --debug echo --msg="hello"`, should print
something like:

```
✔ Mymodule.echo(msg: "hello"): String! 0.5s
  ✔ exec /runtime 0.5s
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.client._session: Configuring shared connection to GraphQL server
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.client._session: Establishing client session to GraphQL server
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: invoke => {'parent_name': 'Mymodule', 'parent_json': '{}', 'name': 'echo', 'input_args': "{'msg': 'hello'}"}
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: resolver => Mymodule.echo
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._resolver: func => <Signature (msg: str) -> str>
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._resolver: input args => {'msg': 'hello'}
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._resolver: structured args => {'msg': 'hello'}
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: result => 'hello'
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: output => '"hello"'
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.client._session: Closing client session to GraphQL server
DEBUG: executing query="query{mymodule{echo(msg:\"hello\")}}"
```

The above gives a lot of useful information:
- The function and parent object that the API wants to execute
- The parent object's state
- The function's signature
- The user inputs before and after deserialization
- The user inputs after being converted to more complex types (structuring)
- The function's result before and after serialization

Additionally, with `--debug`, the GraphQL query that the Dagger CLI produced is also shown.
