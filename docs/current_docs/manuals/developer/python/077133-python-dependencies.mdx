# Python Dependencies

To add a Python dependency, simply [add it to `pyproject.toml`'s `dependencies`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#dependencies-and-requirements), as in the example below:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "infisical-python>=2.1.8",
]
```

Of course, for tools that support it, you can simply use the CLI, as below:

```shell
poetry add infisical-python
```

## Pinned dependencies

Since the module is installed via [`pip install .`](./820256-module-structure.mdx#modules-as-python-libraries), lock files aren't supported yet because they're not a part of the standard build system and thus require using the tool directly. In the meantime, you'll need to pin it:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "infisical-python==2.1.8"
]
```

With Hatch, there is also the option to use a [plugin](https://pypi.org/project/hatch-requirements-txt/) to dynamically use a `requirements.txt` file in `dependencies`, which allows for a [`pip-tools`](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) workflow:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling", "hatch-requirements-txt"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "my-module"
version = "0.1.0"
dynamic = ["dependencies"]

[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.requirements_txt]
files = ["requirements.txt"]
```

Using the fast [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) tool, you can now manage constraints in a separate file:

```
# requirements.in
infisical-python>=2.1.6
```

Then, generate a pinned file from those constraints:

```
uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file now contains:

```
# This file was autogenerated by uv v0.1.5 via the following command:
#    uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
infisical-python==2.1.8
```
