# Python Dependencies

To add a Python dependency, simply [add it to `pyproject.toml`'s `dependencies`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#dependencies-and-requirements), as in the example below:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "infisical-python>=2.1.8",
]
```

Of course, for tools that support it, you can simply use the CLI, as below:

```shell
poetry add infisical-python
```

## Lock file

While Python doesn't have a [lock file standard](https://discuss.python.org/t/lock-files-again-but-this-time-w-sdists/46593/313) yet, other than using a tool that has a proprietary format (like Poetry), the most common way to do it is with a `pip`-compatible format like [`pip-tools`](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) uses.

Since the introduction of [uv](./820256-module-structure.mdx#uv-installer), dependencies are pinned by default using a `requirements.lock` file. If it exists, the Python SDK will use it directly to install dependencies, resulting in a faster installation.

:::tip
Check [compatibility with `pip` and `pip-tools`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/blob/main/PIP_COMPATIBILITY.md) if migrating from or integrating with those tools.
:::

The lock file is only created automatically for new modules. For existing modules that don't have it, it can be created (and updated) manually. For example:

```console
uv pip compile --generate-hashes --update-all -o requirements.lock pyproject.toml sdk/pyproject.toml
```

The above command pulls in dependencies from `pyproject.toml` and `sdk/pyproject.toml`, gets their latest compatible versions, and writes them to `requirements.lock` with added hashes to verify integrity when downloading during install.

:::important
Make sure that `./sdk/pyproject.toml` is up to date first with:

```console
dagger develop
```
:::

:::note
The lock file should only include dependencies, and not the editable installs for the `./sdk` and current module.

### Poetry's lock file

Dagger doesn't support running the `poetry` CLI. It depends on standards like [PEP 517](./820256-module-structure.mdx#modules-as-python-libraries). That means that it doesn't know about the `poetry.lock` file, but the `requirements.lock` file can be generated with [`poetry export`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli#export):

```console
poetry export --with dev --without main -o requirements.lock
```

:::important
The `dagger-io` dev dependency is [not exported correctly](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-plugin-export/issues/145), so it needs to be removed:

```console
sed -i '' '/dagger-io @/d' requirements.lock
```
