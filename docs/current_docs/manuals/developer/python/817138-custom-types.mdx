# Custom Types


A Dagger Module can have multiple object types defined. It's important to
understand though, that they are only accessible through chaining, starting
from a function in the main object.

Here is an example of a "github" module, with a function named `dagger_organization`
that returns a custom `Organization` type, itself containing a collection of
`Account` types:

```python file=./snippets/custom-types/main.py
```

Remember that the [`dagger.field`][dag-field] descriptors expose getter functions
without arguments, for their [attributes](./944887-attribute-functions.mdx).

:::note
When the Dagger Engine extends the Dagger API schema with these types, it prefixes
their names with the name of the main object:
- Github
- GithubAccount
- GithubOrganization

This is to prevent possible naming conflicts when loading multiple modules,
which is reflected in code generation (for example, when using this module in
another one as a dependency).
:::

Here's an example of calling this module to get all member URLs:

```shell
dagger call dagger-organization members url
```

The result will be:

```shell
https://github.com/jane
https://github.com/john
```
