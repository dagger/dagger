# Attributes as Functions


Object attributes can be exposed as Dagger Functions, without having to
create a getter function explicitly.

There's a [dagger.field][dag-field] descriptor that is a wrapper of
[dataclasses.field][data-field], but creates a getter function for the attribute
as well so that it's accessible from the Dagger API.

Here's an example where one attribute is exposed as a function, while the other
is not:

```python file=./snippets/attribute-functions/basic/main.py
```

Notice that compared to [dataclasses.field][data-field], the [dagger.field][dag-field]
wrapper only supports setting `init: bool`, and both `default` and `default_factory`
in the same `default` parameter.

Confirm with `dagger call --help` that only the `greeting` function
was created, with `name` remaining only a constructor argument:

```shell
Flags:
      --greeting string   The greeting to use (default "Hello")
      --name string       Who to greet (default "World")

Function Commands:
  greeting      The greeting to use
  message       Return the greeting message
```

:::note
In a future version of the Python SDK, the same `dagger.function` decorator will
be used as a descriptor in place of `dagger.field` to make the distinction clearer.
