# Developing with Python

Welcome to the Python developer manual!

This manual explains how to use the Dagger Python SDK to 1) query the Dagger API, and 2) extend it with Dagger Functions.

If you're just getting started, the learning path below will give you the essential information you need to understand and begin developing Dagger Modules in Python.

- Understand the [difference between Dagger Modules and Dagger Functions](../modules-vs-functions.mdx)
- Learn about the [architecture](../architecture.mdx) and [execution environment](../execution-environment.mdx) for Dagger Modules
- Write [your first Dagger Module in Python](./419481-first-module.mdx)
- Document your module with [inline comments](./640201-documentation.mdx)
- Streamline your module with a [constructor](./428321-constructor.mdx)
- Work with [secrets](../secrets.mdx)
- Call code from [other modules](../module-dependencies.mdx)
- [Handle errors](../error-handling.mdx) and [debug](./924959-debugging.mdx) your module
- Get [IDE support](../ide-integration.mdx) for your module development

Detailed [reference documentation for the Python SDK](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.org/) is also available.
