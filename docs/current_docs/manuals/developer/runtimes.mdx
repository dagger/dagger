# Alternative Runtimes

:::important
The information on this page is only applicable to the TypeScript SDK. Alternative runtimes are not currently supported in the Python and Go SDKs.
:::

TypeScript is supported by multiple runtimes: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (via `tsx`), [Deno](https://deno.com/) (natively) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (natively). However, the Dagger TypeScript SDK only supports Node.js (stable) and Bun (experimental).

By default, the TypeScript SDK executes functions using the Node.js runtime, but you can configure an alternative runtime in your Dagger module's `package.json` file.

To change the TypeScript SDK runtime, set the field `dagger.runtime` in your Dagger module's `package.json` file.

## Node.js

Set the field to `node` to use the Node.js runtime. Node.js is also the default runtime used if this field is omitted.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "node"
  }
```

## Bun

Set the field to `bun` to use the Bun runtime.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "bun"
  }
```

:::warning
Bun runtime support is still experimental. Unexpected results may occur in some cases.
:::

## Automatic Detection

When a runtime is not explicitly defined within the `package.json` file, Dagger automatically identifies the appropriate runtime by examining the project's lock files inside the project's `dagger` directory.

- If Dagger finds any of the following lock files : `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`, it automatically selects `node` as the runtime.
- In the absence of the lock files mentioned above, if a `bun.lockb` file is present, Dagger will choose `bun` as the runtime.
- If no or only unknown lock files are present, `node` is chosen.

:::warning
This behavior however should be seen as a sensible fallback and not as an explicit configuration.
