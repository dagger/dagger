# State as Functions

Object state can be exposed as a Dagger Function, without having to create a getter function explicitly. Depending on the language used, this state is exposed using struct fields (Go), object attributes (Python) or object properties (TypeScript).

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">
Dagger only exposes a struct's public fields; private fields will not be exposed.

Here's an example where one struct field is exposed as a Dagger Function, while the other is not:

```go file=./snippets/state-functions/go/main.go

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">
The [`dagger.field`](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#dagger.field) descriptor is a wrapper of
[`dataclasses.field`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#mutable-default-values). It creates a getter function for the attribute as well so that it's accessible from the Dagger API.

Here's an example where one attribute is exposed as a Dagger Function, while the other is not:

```python file=./snippets/state-functions/python/main.py

```

Notice that compared to [`dataclasses.field`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#mutable-default-values), the [`dagger.field`](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#dagger.field) wrapper only supports setting `init: bool`, and both `default` and `default_factory` in the same `default` parameter.

:::note
In a future version of the Python SDK, the `dagger.function` decorator will be used as a descriptor in place of `dagger.field` to make the distinction clearer.

<TabItem value="TypeScript">
TypeScript already offers `private`, `protected` and `public` keywords to handle member visibility in a class. However, Dagger will only expose those members of a Dagger module that are explicitly decorated with the `@func()` decorator. Others will remain private.

Here's an example where one field is exposed as a Dagger Function, while the other is not:

```typescript file=./snippets/state-functions/typescript/index.ts

```

:::note
In a future version of the TypeScript SDK, the `@function()` decorator will be used as a descriptor in place of `@func()` to make the distinction clearer.

Confirm with `dagger call --help` that only the `greeting` function was created, with `name` remaining only a constructor argument:

```
FUNCTIONS
  greeting      The greeting to use
  message       Return the greeting message

ARGUMENTS
      --greeting string   The greeting to use (default "Hello")
      --name string       Who to greet (default "World")
```
