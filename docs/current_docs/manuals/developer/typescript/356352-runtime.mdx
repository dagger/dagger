# Runtimes

Multiple runtimes support TypeScript such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

By default, the TypeScript SDK executes functions using the Node.js runtime, but you can configure an alternative runtime in the `package.json` file.

:::note
For now, the TypeScript SDK only supports Node.js (stable) and Bun (experimental).
:::

To change the TypeScript SDK runtime, set the field `dagger.runtime` in the `package.json` file.

## Node  

Set the field to `node` to use the Node.js runtime. Node.js is also the default runtime used if this field is omitted.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "node"
  }
```

## Bun 

Set the field to `bun` to use the Bun runtime.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "bun"
  }
```

:::warning
Bun runtime support is still experimental. Unexpected results may occur in some cases.
:::
## Automatic Detection
When a runtime is not explicitly defined within the `package.json` file, Dagger automatically identifies the appropriate runtime by examining the project's lock files inside the project's `dagger` directory.

- If Dagger finds any of the following lock files : `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`, it automatically selects `node` as the runtime.
- In the absence of the lock files mentioned above, if a `bun.lockb` file is present, Dagger will choose `bun` as the runtime.

- If no or only unknown lock files are present, `node` is chosen.

This behavior however should be seen as a sensible fallback and not as an explicit configuration.
