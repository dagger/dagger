# Decorators


A Dagger Module's functions are declared as methods of a class (decorated with `@object()`) having the same name as the module (in PascalCase).

All objects decorated with `@object()`, functions decorated with `@func()` and fields decorated with `field()` with a decorator are exposed in the Dagger API.

Here is an example of a module that exposes a function `alpine` that returns an object `Alpine` with the method `echo` and the field `ctr`:

```typescript file=./snippets/decorators/index.ts
```

And here is an example of a call to this module:

```shell
dagger call alpine echo --msg="hello","world"
```

The result will be:

```shell
hello world
```

An alternative is to directly query the field `ctr` and [chain](./129302-chaining.mdx) additional function calls to it:

```shell
dagger call alpine ctr with-exec --args "echo","hello","world" stdout
```

This will output the same result as before:

```shell
hello world
```
