# Module Constructor

## Default values for complex types

If a Dagger module constructor expects a Dagger core type (such as `Container`, `Directory`, `Service` etc.) as argument and you wish to assign a default value for this argument, it is necessary to use the `??` notation for this assignment. It is not possible to use the classic TypeScript notation for default arguments because the argument in this case is not a TypeScript primitive.

Here's is an example of a Dagger module with a default constructor argument of type `Container`:

```typescript file=./snippets/constructor/default-object-in-constructor/index.ts
```

This default value can also be assigned directly in the field:

```typescript file=./snippets/constructor/default-object-in-field/index.ts
```

:::note
It is necessary to explicitly declare the type even when a default value is assigned, as the TypeScript SDK needs this information to extend the GraphQL schema correctly.

Here is an example call for this module:

```shell
dagger call version
```

The result will be:

```shell
VERSION_ID=3.14.0
```
