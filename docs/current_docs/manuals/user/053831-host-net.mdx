Dagger Functions do not have access to the network of the host you invoke the function from (i.e. the host you execute a CLI command like `dagger call` from). Instead, host network services need to be explicitly passed when executing `dagger call`.

To pass host network services as arguments when invoking a function, specify them in the form `tcp://<host>:<port>`.
