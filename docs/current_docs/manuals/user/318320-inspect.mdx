Just-in-time artifacts such as containers, directories and files are represented by core Dagger objects such as `Container`, Directory and `File` respectively. Each of these core objects defines various functions, which you can "chain" to inspect or interact with the resulting artifact.

Here is an example of listing the contents of a directory returned by a function, by chaining the entries function to the returned `Directory` object:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.5 call build --project https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args ./cmd/dagger entries
```

Here is an example of printing the contents of the linting rules file returned by a linter function, by chaining the contents function to the returned `File` object:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/dagger/dagger/linters/markdown@88d89e8d15ab6ad9ca4043a920d3cd735a6405fd call rules contents
```

Here is an example of obtaining the size of the ZIP file returned by a file archiving function, by chaining the size function to the returned `File` object:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/sagikazarmark/daggerverse/arc@40057665476af62e617cc8def9ef5a87735264a9 call  archive-directory --name dagger-cli --directory https://github.com/dagger/dagger#main:cmd/dagger  create --format zip size
```

Here is an example of executing a command in a container returned by a function, by chaining the with-exec function to the returned `Container` object:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.2 call container --packages=cowsay with-exec --args cowsay,dagger stdout
```
