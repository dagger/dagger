Dagger Functions can return either basic types or objects. Objects can define their own functions (in the classic object-oriented model). When calling a function that returns an object, the Dagger API lets you follow up by calling one of that object's functions, which itself can return another object, and so on. This is called function chaining, and is a core feature of Dagger.

Dagger's core types (Container, Directory, Service, Secret, ...) are all objects. They each define various functions for interacting with their respective objects.

When a function returns a core type - for example, a directory - the caller typically continues the chain by calling a function from that directory - for example, to export it to the local filesystem, modify it, mount it into a container, etc.
