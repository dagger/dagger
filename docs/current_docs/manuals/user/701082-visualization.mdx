Dagger works by building up a DAG of operations and evaluating them, often in parallel. By nature, this is a difficult thing to display. It's easy to show the output of one operation at a time, but as soon as you have parallelism, you'll get jumbled output that's hard to grok.

This quickly creates the need to visualize the pipeline, to understand what's going on. Dagger includes several features for this.
