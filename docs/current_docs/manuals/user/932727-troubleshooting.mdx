# Troubleshooting Dagger

This page describes problems you may encounter when using Dagger, and their solutions.

## Dagger is unresponsive with a BuildKit error

A Dagger Function may hang or become unresponsive, eventually generating a BuildKit error such as `buildkit failed to respond` or `container state improper`.

To resolve this error, you must stop and remove the Dagger Engine container and (optionally) clear the container state.

1. Stop and remove the Dagger Engine container:

   ```shell
   DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER="$(docker container list --all --filter 'name=^dagger-engine-*' --format '{{.Names}}')"
   docker container stop "$DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER"
   docker container rm "$DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER"
   ```

1. Clear unused volumes and data:

   :::info
   This step is optional. It will remove the cache and result in a slow first run when the container is re-provisioned.
   :::

   ```shell
   docker volume prune
   docker system prune
   ```

You should now be able to run your Dagger Function successfully.

:::note
If you have custom-provisioned the Dagger Engine, please adjust the above commands to your environment.
:::

## Dagger is unable to resolve host names after network configuration changes

If the network configuration of the host changes after the Dagger Engine container starts, Docker does not notify the Dagger Engine of the change. This may cause Dagger to fail with network-related errors.

As an example, if the nameserver configuration of the host changes after switching to a different network connection or connecting/disconnecting a VPN result, Dagger may fail with DNS resolution errors.

To resolve this error, you must restart the Dagger Engine container after the host network configuration changes.

```shell
DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER="$(docker container list --all --filter 'name=^dagger-engine-*' --format '{{.Names}}')"
docker restart "$DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER"
```

You should now be able to re-run your Dagger Function successfully.

## Calling a Dagger Function fails

A Dagger Function may fail with one of the following errors and/or cause the Dagger Engine to crash:

- `unable to start container process`
- `failed to update codegen and runtime`
- `failed to generate code`
- `failed to get modified source directory for go module sdk codegen`

This can occur when you have the `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM` environment variable set and/or when Rosetta is enabled in Docker Desktop for Mac.

To resolve this error, you must remove the environment variable, disable Rosetta if applicable, and remove existing Dagger Engine containers.

1. Remove the `DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM` variable in your current shell and/or your equivalent shell config files (`.bashrc`, `.profile`, `.zshrc`, ...) and restart the shell.
1. Ensure that [Rosetta is disabled in Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/).
1. Remove any running Dagger Engine containers and Docker images:

    ```shell
    docker rm -fv $(docker ps --filter name="dagger-engine-*" -q) && docker rmi $(docker images -q --filter reference=registry.dagger.io/engine)
    ```

## Dagger restarts with a "CNI setup error"

The Dagger Engine requires the `iptable_nat` Linux kernel module in order to function properly. On some Linux distributions (including Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x and 9.x), this module is not loaded by default.

You can load this module by running `sudo modprobe iptable_nat`.

To have this module loaded automatically on startup, add it to the `/etc/modules-load.d/modules` file with the following command:

```shell
echo iptable_nat | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/modules
```
