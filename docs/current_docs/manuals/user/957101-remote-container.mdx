Dagger Functions that accept container arguments can be passed the address(es) of one or more OCI images. The CLI will dynamically pull the image, and pass the resulting `Container` object as argument to the function.

Here is an example of passing a container image reference to a function as an argument. The function scans the container using Trivy and reports any vulnerabilities found.

```shell
dagger -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy@v0.3.0 call scan-container --ctr index.docker.io/alpine:latest
```
