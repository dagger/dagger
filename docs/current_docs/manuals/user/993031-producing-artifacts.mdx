Dagger is commonly used to dynamically produce artifacts. This includes building binaries, building containers, generating code or documentation, linting, minification, and so on.

This is done by calling functions that return the `Container`, `Directory` or `File` core types.  When calling such functions, the CLI receives a just-in-time artifact: a reference to a dynamic pipeline which, when executed, will produce an artifact.

The CLI can then add more functions to the pipeline (chaining) for further processing - for example, inspecting the contents of a directory artifact, exporting a file artifact to the local filesystem, publishing a container artifact to a registry, and so on.
