# Just-in-Time Artifacts

Dagger is commonly used to dynamically produce artifacts. This includes building binaries, building containers, generating code or documentation, linting, minification, and so on.

These artifacts, in turn, expose various functions that allow them to be inspected or processed further. These functions can be invoked from the Dagger CLI using function chaining.

This section explains important concepts and techniques for you to know when producing and consuming artifacts with Dagger Functions.
