# Command Execution in Containers

The Dagger CLI can add follow-up processing to a just-in-time container, essentially enabling you to continue the pipeline directly from the command-line. `Container` objects expose a `WithExec()` function, which lets you execute a command in the corresponding container.

Here is an example of chaining a `WithExec()` function call to a container returned by a Wolfi container builder Dagger Function, to display and return the contents of the `/etc/os-release` file:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.2 call container with-exec --args="cat","/etc/os-release" stdout
```

Here is another examples which chains multiple `WithExec()` calls to install the `curl` package in a Wolfi container, use it to send an HTTP request, and return the output:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.3 call container with-exec --args "apk,add,curl" with-exec --args "curl,-L,dagger.io" stdout
```
