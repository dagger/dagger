# Consume Artifacts

Depending on its nature, every just-in-time artifact exposes various functions that allow it to be inspected or processed further. These functions can be invoked from the Dagger CLI through function chaining.

For example, all just-in-time containers, directories and files expose a function that enables them to be exported to the host filesystem. Similarly, all just-in-time containers expose functions to publish the container image to a registry, or open an interactive session with the running container.
