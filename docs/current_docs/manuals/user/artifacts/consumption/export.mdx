# Artifact Export

Just-in-time artifacts such as containers, directories and files expose an `Export()` function, enabling them to be exported to the host filesystem from the Dagger Function that produced them. The destination path on the host is passed to the function using the `--path` argument.

Here is an example of exporting the directory returned by a Go builder Dagger Function to the `./my-build` directory on the host:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.10 call build --source=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger export --path=./my-build
```

:::info
The Dagger CLI also has a global `--output` flag, which can be used as an alternative to the `Export()` function when exporting artifacts to the host. Here is an example:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.10 call build --source=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger --output=./my-build
```

The `--output` flag returns the absolute path of the saved resource on the host, instead of a simple Boolean `true` or `false`.
:::

By default, the `Export()` function exports the files that exist in the returned directory to the host, but it does not modify or delete any files that already exist at that host path. To replace the contents of the target host directory, such that it exactly matches the directory being exported, add the `--wipe` argument.

Here is an example of exporting the build directory returned by the same Dagger Function above, deleting and replacing files as needed in the `./my-build` directory on the host:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.10 call build --source=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger export --path=./my-build --wipe
```

Instead of exporting an entire directory, you can also export a file. Here is an example of exporting a single file from the directory returned by the same Go builder Dagger Function, as `./my-binary-file` on the host:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.10 call build --source=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger file --path=dagger export --path=./my-binary-file
```

Here is another example, this time exporting the rules file used by a linter Dagger Function as `/tmp/rules` on the host:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/dagger/dagger/linters/markdown@88d89e8d15ab6ad9ca4043a920d3cd735a6405fd call rules export --path=/tmp/rules
```

Here is an example of exporting a container returned by a Wolfi container builder Dagger Function as an OCI tarball named `/tmp/tarball.tar.gz` on the host:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.2 container export --path=./tarball.tar.gz
```
