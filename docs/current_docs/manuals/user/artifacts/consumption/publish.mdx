# Container Publication to a Registry

Every `Container` object exposes a `Publish()` function, which publishes the container as a new image to a specified container registry. The registry address is passed to the function using the `--address` argument, and the return value is a string referencing the container image address in the registry.

Here is an example of publishing the container returned by a Wolfi container builder Dagger Function to the `ttl.sh` registry, by chaining a `Publish()` function call to the container:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.2 container publish --address=ttl.sh/my-wolfi
```
