# Just-in-Time Containers

Just-in-time containers are produced by calling a Dagger Function that returns the `Container` type. This type provides a complete API for building, running and distributing containers.

Just-in-time containers might be produced by a Dagger Function that:

- Builds a container
- Minifies a container
- Downloads a container image from a running registry
- Exports a container from Docker or other container runtimes
- Snapshots the state of a running container

You can think of a just-in-time container, and the `Container` type that represents it, as a build stage in Dockerfile. Each operation produces a new immutable state, which can be further processed, or exported as an OCI image. Dagger Functions can accept, return and pass containers between themselves, just like regular variables.

Here is an example of a Wolfi container builder Dagger Function that returns a base Wolfi container image with a list of additional specified packages:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.2 call container --packages=cowsay
```

Once the command completes, you should see this output:

```shell
Container evaluated. Use "dagger call base with-package container --help" to see available sub-commands.
```

This means that the build succeeded, and a `Container` type representing the built container image was returned.
