# Just-in-Time Directories

Just-in-time directories are produced by calling a Dagger Function that returns the `Directory` type.

Just-in-time directories might be produced by a Dagger Function that:

- Builds language-specific binaries
- Downloads source code from git or another remote source
- Processes source code (for example, generating documentation or linting code)
- Downloads or processes datasets
- Downloads machine learning models

Here is an example of a Go builder Dagger Function that accepts a remote Git address (the address of Dagger's open-source repository) as a `Directory` argument, builds a Go binary from the source code in that repository, and returns the build directory containing the compiled binary.

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.5 call build --project=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger
```

Once the command completes, you should see this output:

```shell
Directory evaluated. Use "dagger call build --help" to see available sub-commands.
```

This means that the build succeeded, and a `Directory` type representing the build directory was returned.
