# Produce and Inspect Artifacts

Artifacts are produced by calling Dagger Functions that return the `Container`, `Directory` or `File` core types. When calling such Dagger Functions, the CLI receives a just-in-time artifact: a reference to a dynamic pipeline which, when executed, will produce an artifact.

The CLI can then add more functions to the pipeline (chaining) for further processing - for example, inspecting the contents of a directory artifact, exporting a file artifact to the local filesystem, publishing a container artifact to a registry, and so on.
