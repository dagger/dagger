# Just-in-Time Files

Just-in-time files are produced by calling a Dagger Function that returns the `File` type.

Just-in-time files might be produced by a Dagger Function that:

- Builds language-specific binaries
- Combines multiple input files into a single output file, such as a composite video or a compressed archive

Here is an example of a linter Dagger Function that returns the linting rules used by it as a file:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/dagger/dagger/dev/ruff@a29dadbb5d9968784847a15fccc5629daf2985ae lint --source https://github.com/dagger/dagger report
```

Once the command completes, you should see something like this output:

```shell
_type: File
name: ruff-report.json
size: 1476
```

This means that the function succeeded, and a `File` type representing the linting report file was returned.

Here is another example of a file builder Dagger Function that returns a ZIP archive of the `cmd/dagger` directory in the Dagger GitHub repository:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/sagikazarmark/daggerverse/arc@40057665476af62e617cc8def9ef5a87735264a9 call  archive-directory --name=dagger-cli '--directory=https://github.com/dagger/dagger#main:cmd/dagger'  create --format=zip
```
