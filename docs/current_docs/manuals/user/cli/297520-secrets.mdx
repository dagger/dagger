# Work with Secrets

Dagger allows you to utilize confidential information, such as passwords, API keys, SSH keys and so on, in your Dagger Functions, without exposing those secrets in plaintext logs, writing them into the filesystem of containers you're building, or inserting them into the cache.

Secrets in Dagger Functions are represented using the `Secret` core type.

:::note
Dagger automatically scrubs secrets from its various logs and output streams. This ensures that sensitive data does not leak - for example, in the event of a crash.

## Pass a secret to a function as an argument

To pass a secret to a function, source it from a host environment variable (`env:`), the host filesystem (`file:`), or a host command (`cmd:`).

For example, pass a GitHub access token from an environment variable named `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the `run` function of the `gh` module:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/aweris/daggerverse/gh@99a1336f8091ff43bf833778a324de1cadcf25ac call run --token=env:GITHUB_TOKEN --cmd="issue list --repo dagger/dagger"
```

Or, pass the token from a host file named `github-token.txt`:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/aweris/daggerverse/gh@99a1336f8091ff43bf833778a324de1cadcf25ac call run --token=file:/home/admin/github-token.txt --cmd="issue list --repo dagger/dagger"
```

Or, pass the token from the output of a command executed on the host:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/aweris/daggerverse/gh@99a1336f8091ff43bf833778a324de1cadcf25ac call run --token=cmd:"gh auth token" --cmd="issue list --repo dagger/dagger"
```
