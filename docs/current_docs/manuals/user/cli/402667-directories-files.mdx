# Work with Directories and Files

## List the contents of a directory returned by a function

To list the contents of a directory returned by a function, use `dagger call FUNCTION-NAME entries`.

For example, to list the contents of the directory returned by the `build` function of the `golang` module, use:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.5 call build --project=https://github.com/golang/example --args="-C","./hello" entries
```

## Export a file or directory returned by a function to the host

To export a file or directory returned by a function to the host, use `dagger call FUNCTION-NAME export --path HOST-PATH-FOR-EXPORT`.

When a function returns a directory, a specific file from the directory can be exported to the host with `dagger call FUNCTION-NAME file --path FILE-TO-EXPORT export --path HOST-PATH-FOR-EXPORT`. Note that `FILE-TO-EXPORT` must be specified relative to the directory returned by the function.

For example, to export the directory returned by the `build` function of the `golang` module to the `./my-build` directory on the host, use:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.5 call build --project=https://github.com/dagger/dagger#main --args=./cmd/dagger export --path=./my-build
```

To export the compiled binary file from the directory returned by the `build` function of the `golang` module as `/tmp/my-binary` on the host, use:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.5 call build --project=https://github.com/dagger/dagger#main --args=./cmd/dagger file --path=./dagger export --path=/tmp/my-binary
```
