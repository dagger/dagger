# Call Dagger Functions

The simplest and most common way to call Dagger Functions is to use the Dagger CLI. The Dagger CLI is a full-featured, easy to use tool that can be used interactively from a terminal or non-interactively from a shell script or a CI configuration.

Here is an example of calling a Dagger Function using the Dagger CLI:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello
```

Here's what you should see:

```shell
hello, world!
```

In this example, the Dagger CLI is first loading a `hello` module directly from its GitHub repository and then executing the `Hello()` function from that module.

If you inspect the source code of the module, you'll see a `Hello()` function, written in Go, which prepares a message and returns it as a string.
