# Functions

To use Dagger, you call Dagger Functions. Dagger Functions are regular code, written in a supported programming language, and run in containers. Dagger Functions let you encapsulate common operations or workflows into discrete units with clear inputs and outputs.

The Dagger Engine provides some core functions, but you are encouraged to write your own and share them with others. Dagger also lets you import and reuse modules developed by your team, your organization or the broader Dagger community. Functions are packaged, shared and reused using modules. You can call functions from external modules in exactly the same way as you would call core functions.

Modules don't need to be installed locally. Dagger lets you consume modules from GitHub repositories as well.

This section explains important concepts and techniques for you to know when working with Dagger Functions.
