# Host Environment Access

Dagger Functions do not have access to environment variables on the host you invoke the Dagger Function from (i.e. the host you execute a CLI command like `dagger call` from). Instead, these variables need to be explicitly passed when executing `dagger call`.

To pass host environment variable values as arguments when invoking a Dagger Function, use the standard shell convention of `$ENV_VAR_NAME` when using `dagger call`.

Here is an example of passing a host environment variable containing a string value to a Dagger Function:

```shell
export GREETING=bonjour
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello --greeting=$GREETING
```

To pass a secret stored in a host environment variable as arguments when invoking a Dagger Function, add the `env:` prefix to the environment variable name.

Here is an example of passing a host environment variable containing an access token to a Dagger Function as a secret:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/aweris/daggerverse/gh@99a1336f8091ff43bf833778a324de1cadcf25ac call run --token=env:GITHUB_TOKEN --cmd="issue list --repo=dagger/dagger"
```
