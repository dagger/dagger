# Remote Container Images

Dagger Functions that accept container arguments can be passed the address(es) of one or more OCI images. The CLI will dynamically pull the image, and pass the resulting `Container` object as argument to the Dagger Function.

Here is an example of passing a container image reference to a Dagger Function as an argument. The Dagger Function scans the container using Trivy and reports any vulnerabilities found.

```shell
dagger -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy@v0.3.0 call scan-container --ctr=index.docker.io/alpine:latest
```
