# Remote Repositories

Dagger supports the use of remote repositories in two distinct ways:

- As Dagger modules
- As directory arguments to Dagger Functions

In both cases, Dagger supports the use of HTTP and SSH protocols for accessing remote repositories, compatible with all major Git hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Azure DevOps, Codeberg, and Sourcehut. For SSH references ("refs"), Dagger employs a unified authentication approach.

## Supported protocols and schemes

Dagger supports various reference schemes for remote repositories and modules, as below.

FIXME for Guillaume: Can we make this table work for both cases: ie modules and dir args? we can discuss

| Protocol | Scheme            | Private Modules Support | Example                                      |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| HTTP     | Go-like ref style | In progress               | `github.com/username/repo[/subdir][@version]`  |
| HTTP     | Git HTTP style    | In progress               | `https://github.com/username/repo.git[/subdir][@version]` |
| SSH      | SCP-like          | Supported               | `git@github.com:username/repo.git[/subdir][@version]`     |
| SSH      | Explicit SSH      | Supported               | `ssh://git@github.com/username/repo.git[/subdir][@version]` |

Dagger provides additional flexibility in referencing modules through the following options:

FIXME question for Guillaume: is the below only applicable for MODULES in private repos? or all private repos?

- The `.git` extension is optional for HTTP refs or explicit SSH refs, except for [GitLab, when referencing modules stored on a private repo or private subgroup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/middleware/go.rb#L229-237).
- Monorepo support: Append `/subpath` to access a specific subdirectory within the repository.
- Version specification: Add `@version` to target a particular version of the module. This can be a tag, branch name, or full commit hash. If omitted, the default branch is used.

### Configuring SSH authentication

Dagger mounts the socket specified by your host's `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable to the Dagger Engine. This is essential for SSH refs, as most Git servers use your SSH key for authentication and tracking purposes, even when cloning public repositories.

This means that you must ensure that the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable is properly set in your environment when using SSH refs with Dagger.

[Read detailed instructions on setting up SSH authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), including how to generate SSH keys, start the SSH agent, and add your keys.

### Best practices

For quick and easy referencing:
- Copy the repository ref from your preferred Git server's UI.
- Add a `/subpath` if you need to target a specific directory within the repository.
- Append `@version` if you want to specify a particular version or commit.

## Remote repositories as directory arguments

Dagger Functions that accept directory arguments are equally comfortable receiving local filesystem paths or remote Git repository references. In both cases, the CLI will convert it to an object referencing the contents of that filesystem path or Git repository location, and pass the resulting `Directory` object as argument to the Dagger Function.

Here is an example of passing a remote Git address (the address of Dagger's open-source repository) as a `Directory` argument:

```shell
dagger core container \
  from --address=alpine:latest \
  with-directory --path=/src --directory=https://github.com/dagger/dagger \
  with-exec --args="ls","/src" \
  stdout
```

In addition to supporting public repositories, Dagger also supports the use of private repositories over SSH as directory arguments. Here is the same example, this time using SSH (note that this requires SSH authentication to be properly configured on your Dagger host):

```shell
dagger core container \
  from --address=alpine:latest \
  with-directory --path=/src --directory=ssh://git@github.com/dagger/dagger \
  with-exec --args="ls","/src" \
  stdout
```

## Consume Dagger modules in remote repositories

Modules don't need to be installed locally. Dagger lets you consume modules from both public and private Git repositories as well.

Here is an example of using a Go builder Dagger module from a public repository:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.2.0 call \
  build --source=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger \
  export --path=./build
```

Here is an example of using a Dagger module from a private repository:

FIXME for Guillaume: Add example of consuming Dagger module in private repo

## Known limitations and workarounds

This section outlines current limitations and provides workarounds for common issues. We're actively working on improvements for these areas.

### Windows is not supported

Currently, SSH refs are fully supported on UNIX-based systems (Linux and macOS). Windows support is under development. Track progress and contribute to the discussion in our [GitHub issue for Windows support](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/8313).

### Multiple SSH keys may cause SSH forwarding to fail

SSH forwarding may fail when multiple keys are loaded in your SSH agent. This is under active investigation in our [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/8288). Until this is resolved, the following workaround may be used:

1. Clear all loaded keys: `ssh-add -D`
2. Add back only the required key: `ssh-add /path/to/key`

### Environment variables are not automatically expanded

Shell expansion characters (e.g., `~`) in the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable are not automatically expanded. This is under active investigation in our [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/8337). Until this is resolved, the workaround is to use the full path instead of `~` when setting `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.

### `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` paths are not always handled correctly

The Dagger CLI incorrectly handles the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` path by converting it to a relative path from the Dagger CLI's current working directory. This can lead to issues with SSH forwarding, especially when the socket path is in the same directory tree as the working directory. A fix for this issue is [in progress](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8365)

Until this is resolved, ensure that the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` path is not on the same path as your current working directory (except for the root directory '/'). A simple workaround is to create a symlink in `/var/run` or `/tmp` that points to the value of `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, and then export this new path as SSH_AUTH_SOCK.
