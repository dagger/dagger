# Remote Repositories

Dagger supports the use of remote repositories in two distinct ways:

- As directory arguments to Dagger Functions
- As Dagger modules

In both cases, Dagger supports the use of HTTP and SSH protocols for accessing remote repositories, compatible with all major Git hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Azure DevOps, Codeberg, and Sourcehut. For SSH references ("refs"), Dagger employs a unified authentication approach.

## Use remote repositories as directory arguments

Dagger Functions that accept directory arguments are equally comfortable receiving local filesystem paths or remote Git repository references. In both cases, the CLI will convert it to an object referencing the contents of that filesystem path or Git repository location, and pass the resulting `Directory` object as argument to the Dagger Function.

### Supported protocols and schemes

Dagger supports the following reference schemes for directory arguments:

| Protocol | Scheme     | Public repositories | Private repositories | Example |
|----------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| HTTP(S)  | Git HTTP   | Supported | In progress | `https://github.com/username/repo.git[#version[:subdir]]` |
| SSH      | Explicit   | Supported | Supported | `ssh://git@github.com/username/repo.git[#version[:subdir]]` |
| SSH      | SCP-like   | Supported | Supported | `git@github.com:username/repo.git[#version[:subdir]]`     |

:::note
The reference scheme for directory arguments is currently under discussion [here](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/6957) and [here](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/6944) and may change in future.
:::

Dagger provides additional flexibility in referencing directory arguments through the following options:

- Version specification: Add `#version` to target a particular version of the repository. This can be a tag, branch name, or full commit hash. If omitted, the default branch is used.
- Monorepo support: Append `:subpath` after the version specification to access a specific subdirectory within the repository. Note that specifying a version is mandatory when including a subpath.

:::important
When referencing a specific subdirectory (subpath) within a repository, you must always include a version specification. The format is always `#version:subpath`.
:::

### Examples

Here is an example of passing a remote repository (Dagger's open-source repository) over HTTPS as a `Directory` argument:

```shell
dagger core container \
  from --address=alpine:latest \
  with-directory --path=/src --directory=https://github.com/dagger/dagger \
  with-exec --args="ls","/src" \
  stdout
```

In addition to supporting HTTP(S) access for public repositories, Dagger also supports the use of SSH for both public and private repositories. Note that this requires [SSH authentication to be properly configured](#configuring-ssh-authentication) on your Dagger host. Here is the same example, this time using SSH:

```shell
dagger core container \
  from --address=alpine:latest \
  with-directory --path=/src --directory=ssh://git@github.com/dagger/dagger \
  with-exec --args="ls","/src" \
  stdout
```

## Consume Dagger modules from remote repositories

Modules don't need to be installed locally. Dagger lets you consume modules from both public and private Git repositories as well.

### Supported protocols and schemes

Dagger supports various reference schemes for Dagger modules, as below:

| Protocol | Scheme            | Public repositories | Private repositories | Example |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| HTTP(S)  | Go-like ref style | Supported | In progress | `github.com/username/repo[/subdir][@version]`  |
| HTTP(S)  | Git HTTP style    | Supported | In progress | `https://github.com/username/repo.git[/subdir][@version]` |
| SSH      | SCP-like          | Supported | Supported | `git@github.com:username/repo.git[/subdir][@version]`     |
| SSH      | Explicit SSH      | Supported | Supported | `ssh://git@github.com/username/repo.git[/subdir][@version]` |

Dagger provides additional flexibility in referencing modules through the following options:

- The `.git` extension is optional for HTTP refs or explicit SSH refs, except for [GitLab, when referencing modules stored on a private repo or private subgroup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/middleware/go.rb#L229-237).
- Monorepo support: Append `/subpath` to access a specific subdirectory within the repository.
- Version specification: Add `@version` to target a particular version of the module. This can be a tag, branch name, or full commit hash. If omitted, the default branch is used.

### Examples

Here is an example of using a Go builder Dagger module from a public repository over HTTPS:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.2.0 call \
  build --source=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger \
  export --path=./build
```

Here is the same example using SSH authentication. Note that this requires [SSH authentication to be properly configured](#configuring-ssh-authentication) on your Dagger host).

```shell
dagger -m git@github.com:kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.2.0 call \
  build --source=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger \
  export --path=./build
```

## Configuring SSH authentication

Dagger mounts the socket specified by your host's `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable to the Dagger Engine. This is essential for SSH refs, as most Git servers use your SSH key for authentication and tracking purposes, even when cloning public repositories.

This means that you must ensure that the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable is properly set in your environment when using SSH refs with Dagger.

[Read detailed instructions on setting up SSH authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), including how to generate SSH keys, start the SSH agent, and add your keys.

## Best practices

For quick and easy referencing:
- Copy the repository ref from your preferred Git server's UI.
- To specify a particular version or commit, append `#version` (for directory arguments) or `@version` (for modules).
- To target a specific directory within the repository, use the format `#version:subpath` (for directory arguments) or add a `/subpath` (for modules). Remember that the version is mandatory when specifying a subpath.

## Known limitations and workarounds

This section outlines current limitations and provides workarounds for common issues. We're actively working on improvements for these areas.

### Windows is not supported

Currently, SSH refs are fully supported on UNIX-based systems (Linux and macOS). Windows support is under development. Track progress and contribute to the discussion in our [GitHub issue for Windows support](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/8313).

### Multiple SSH keys may cause SSH forwarding to fail

SSH forwarding may fail when multiple keys are loaded in your SSH agent. This is under active investigation in our [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/8288). Until this is resolved, the following workaround may be used:

1. Clear all loaded keys: `ssh-add -D`
2. Add back only the required key: `ssh-add /path/to/key`
