# Remote Repositories

Dagger Functions that accept directory arguments are equally comfortable receiving local filesystem paths or remote Git repository references. In both cases, the CLI will convert it to an object referencing the contents of that filesystem path or Git repository location, and pass the resulting `Directory` object as argument to the Dagger Function.

Here is an example of a Go builder Dagger Function that accepts a remote Git address (the address of Dagger's open-source repository) as a `Directory` argument, builds a binary version of the Dagger CLI and exports the build directory to the host filesystem as `./build`:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.2.0 call build --source=https://github.com/dagger/dagger --args=./cmd/dagger export --path=./build
```

## Dagger Module Ref Schemes

Dagger supports various ref schemes for remote modules, accommodating both HTTP and SSH protocols. These schemes are compatible with all Git repositories hosted on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Azure DevOps, Codeberg, and Sourcehut.

### Supported Protocols and Schemes

| Protocol | Scheme            | Private Modules Support | Example                                      |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| HTTP     | Go-like ref style | Incoming*               | `github.com/username/repo[/subdir][@version]`  |
| HTTP     | Git HTTP style    | Incoming*               | `https://github.com/username/repo.git[/subdir][@version]` |
| SSH      | SCP-like          | Supported               | `git@github.com:username/repo.git[/subdir][@version]`     |
| SSH      | Explicit SSH      | Supported               | `ssh://git@github.com/username/repo.git[/subdir][@version]` |

*Incoming: Support for private modules via HTTP is planned for a future release.

### Additional Ref Options

Dagger provides flexibility in referencing modules through the following options:

- The `.git` extension is optional for HTTP refs or explicit SSH refs, except for [GitLab, when referencing modules stored on a private repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/middleware/go.rb#L229-237).
- **Monorepo support**: Append `/subpath` to access a specific subdirectory within the repository.
- **Version specification**: Add `@version` to target a particular version of the module. This can be a tag, branch name, or full commit hash.

These options are optional. If omitted, Dagger defaults to the default branch of the repository.

### SSH Refs and Authentication

When using SSH refs, it's crucial to understand how Dagger handles authentication:

Dagger mounts the socket specified by your host's `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable to the engine. This is essential for SSH refs, as most Git servers use your SSH key for authentication and tracking purposes, even when cloning public repositories. Ensure that the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable is properly set in your environment when using SSH refs.

For detailed instructions on setting up SSH authentication, including how to generate SSH keys, start the SSH agent, and add your keys, please refer to the following external documentation:

[Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

This guide provides comprehensive information on:

- Generating SSH key pairs
- Setting up public key authentication on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Configuring SSH clients
- Best practices for SSH key management

By following this guide, you can ensure that your SSH authentication is properly configured for use with Dagger.

### Examples

| Description                               | Example                                      |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| HTTP Go-like ref with subpath and version | `github.com/username/repo/subpath@v1.0.0`    |
| SSH SCP-like ref with subpath             | `git@github.com:username/repo.git/subpath`   |
| Explicit SSH ref with version             | `ssh://git@github.com/username/repo.git@v2.1.3` |

### Best Practices

For quick and easy referencing:
- Copy the repository ref from your preferred Git server's UI.
- Add a `/subpath` if you need to target a specific directory within the repository.
- Append `@version` if you want to specify a particular version or commit.

### FAQ

#### 1. What systems are supported ?

Currently SSH refs are supported on UNIX systems, but an [exploration for Windows support is ongoing](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/8313)
