# Get Started with Dagger Cloud

## Introduction

Dagger Cloud provides pipeline visualization, operational insights, and distributed caching for your Daggerized pipelines.

This guide helps you get started with Dagger Cloud. Here are the steps you'll follow:

- [Sign up for Dagger Cloud](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud)
- [Send telemetry to Dagger Cloud](#step-2-send-telemetry-to-dagger-cloud)
- [Visualize pipeline runs with Dagger Cloud](#step-3-visualize-your-pipeline-runs-with-dagger-cloud)
- [Synchronize cache volumes with the Dagger Cloud experimental distributed cache (available on the Team plan)](#step-4-use-cache-volumes-with-the-experimental-dagger-cloud-cache)

:::note Dagger Cloud plans
Dagger Cloud includes plans for both individuals and teams. [See more information about the plans](https://www.dagger.io/pricing).
:::

## Prerequisites

- You have an understanding of how Dagger works. If not, [read the Dagger Quickstart](../../../quickstart/index.mdx).
- You have a GitHub account (required for Dagger Cloud identity verification). If not, [register for a free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
- You have a source code repository and a Dagger Module that interacts with it. If not, fork and locally clone the [Dagger source code repository](https://github.com/dagger/dagger), which you can use with a [Go builder module](https://github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/tree/main/golang).

## Step 1: Sign up for Dagger Cloud

:::info
At the end of this step, you will have signed up for Dagger Cloud and obtained a Dagger Cloud token. If you already have a Dagger Cloud account and token, you may skip this step.
:::

Follow the steps below to sign up for Dagger Cloud, create an organization and obtain a Dagger Cloud token.

1. Sign up for Dagger Cloud by selecting a plan on the [Dagger website](https://www.dagger.io/pricing). Click **Continue with GitHub** to log in with your GitHub account.

1. After authorizing Dagger Cloud for your GitHub account, you'll create your organization.

    :::info Naming your organization
    Organization names may contain alphanumeric characters and dashes and are unique across Dagger Cloud. We recommend using your company name or team name for your organization.
    :::

1. Review and select a Dagger Cloud subscription plan.

1. If you selected the **Team** plan:

    1. You will be presented with the option to add teammates to your Dagger Cloud account. This step is optional and not available in the Individual plan.

    1. You will then enter your payment information. After your free 14 day trial completes, you will be automatically subscribed to the Dagger Cloud Team plan.

1. Click **Go to dashboard**. The next step walks you through how to send telemetry to Dagger Cloud.

## Step 2: Connect to Dagger Cloud

:::info
At the end of this step, you will have connected Dagger Cloud with your local development environment or with your CI provider or CI tool using your Dagger Cloud token. If you have already connected Dagger Cloud and don't see data yet in your dashboard, skip to the next step.
:::

You can use Dagger Cloud with your CI and for your local development workflows. You instruct your Dagger Engine to connect to Dagger Cloud by referencing your unique Dagger Cloud token. Dagger Cloud creates this token automatically when you sign up.

To find your token, browse to the **Organization Settings** page, by clicking your profile photo in the left sidebar and then clicking **Organization Settings**. Select the **Configuration** tab. You can also use this URL pattern: `https://dagger.cloud/{Your Org Name}/settings?tab=configuration`

    ![Get token](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/get-started/get-token.png)

  :::warning
  If you regenerate your token, you must replace the token wherever you've referenced it. To reduce operational interruptions, only regenerate your token if it has been leaked.
  :::

Once you have your token, you can now use it to connect Dagger Cloud with your CI and/or local development machines.

### Connect from your local development host

You can visualize and debug your local Dagger pipeline runs with Dagger Cloud to identify issues before pushing them to CI.

To configure for local development, set your Dagger Cloud token as an environment variable. For example:

```shell
export DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN={your token}
```

:::info BEST PRACTICES FOR VISUALIZING LOCAL RUNS IN DAGGER CLOUD
Dagger Cloud uses metadata from your version control system (VCS), such as Git, to populate some information in the user interface. Therefore, you should run your Dagger pipelines within a VCS context, such as a local directory linked to a cloned Git repository.
:::

### Connect from your CI engine

The general procedure to connect Dagger Cloud with a CI provider/CI tool is:

- Add your Dagger Cloud token to your CI workflows.
  - Store the Dagger Cloud token as a secret with your CI.
    :::danger Keep your Dagger Cloud token private
    You must store the Dagger Cloud token as a secret (not plaintext) with your CI provider and reference it in your CI's workflow. Using a secret is recommended to protect your Dagger Cloud account from being used by forks of your project. We provide links in the steps below for configuring secrets with popular CI tools.
    :::
  - Add the secret to your CI environment as a variable named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`.
- For **Team** plan subscribers with ephemeral CI runners only: Add a wait step (example below) for the Docker configuration to allow the Dagger Engine to push cache volumes to the experimental Dagger Cloud distributed cache. Subscribers on the **Individual** plan do not have access to the experimental distributed cache and do not need to add this step.
- If you are using GitHub Actions, install the Dagger Cloud GitHub app for GitHub Checks. This app adds a GitHub Check to your pull requests and links to the run status and pipeline visualization for the commit in Dagger Cloud.

You can use Dagger Cloud whether you're hosting your own CI runners and infrastructure or using hosted/SaaS runners.

:::danger
When using self-hosted CI runners on AWS infrastructure, NAT Gateways are a common source of unexpected network charges. It's advisable to setup an Amazon S3 Gateway for these cases. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html) for detailed information on how to do this.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="GitLab CI">

1. Create a new CI/CD project variable in your GitLab project named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`, and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Ensure that you configure the project variable to be masked and protected. Refer to the GitLab documentation on [creating CI/CD project variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#define-a-cicd-variable-in-the-ui) and [CI/CD variable security](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#cicd-variable-security).

1. Update your GitLab CI workflow and add the variable to your CI environment. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`. Refer to the GitLab documentation on [using CI/CD variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/index.html#use-cicd-variables-in-job-scripts).

    [See an example of a sample GitLab workflow file](../../../integrations/734201-gitlab.mdx)

1. For **Team** plan subscribers with ephemeral CI runners only: Update your GitLab CI workflow (example below) and adjust the `docker stop` timeout period so that Docker waits longer before killing the Dagger Engine container, to give it more time to push data to the Dagger Cloud cache. Refer to the Docker documentation on the [`docker stop` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="CircleCI">

1. Create a new environment variable in your CircleCI project named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Refer to the CircleCI documentation on [creating environment variables for a project](https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).

1. For **Team** plan subscribers with ephemeral CI runners only: Update your CircleCI workflow (example below) and adjust the `docker stop` timeout period so that Docker waits longer before killing the Dagger Engine container, to give it more time to push data to the Dagger Cloud cache. Refer to the Docker documentation on the [`docker stop` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop/).

1. For GitHub, GitLab or Atlassian Bitbucket source code repositories only: Update your CircleCI workflow and add the following pipeline values to the CI environment. Refer to the CircleCI documentation on [using pipeline values](https://circleci.com/docs/variables/#pipeline-values).

    environment:
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_NUMBER: << pipeline.number >>
    ```

    GitLab:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_NUMBER: << pipeline.number >>
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_TRIGGER_LOGIN: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.user_username >>
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_REPO_URL: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.repo_url >>
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_REPO_FULL_NAME: << pipeline.trigger_parameters.gitlab.repo_name >>
    ```

    Atlassian BitBucket:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      CIRCLE_PIPELINE_NUMBER: << pipeline.number >>
    ```

    [See an example of a sample CircleCI workflow](../../../integrations/592501-circleci.mdx)


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Jenkins">

1. Configure a Jenkins credential named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). Refer to the Jenkins documentation on [creating credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/#configuring-credentials) and [credential security](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/#credential-security).

1. Update your Jenkins Pipeline and add the variable to the CI environment. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` and can be referenced in the Pipeline environment using the format `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN = credentials('DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN')`. Refer to the Jenkins documentation on [handling credentials](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#handling-credentials).

    [See an example of a sample Jenkins Pipeline](../../../integrations/322019-jenkins.mdx)

:::note
- This Jenkins Pipeline assumes that the the Dagger CLI is pre-installed on the Jenkins runner(s), together with other required dependencies.
- If you use the same Jenkins server for more than one Dagger Cloud organization, create distinct credentials for each organization and link them to their respective Dagger Cloud tokens.
- Typically, Jenkins servers are non-ephemeral and therefore it is not necessary to adjust the `docker stop` timeout.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Argo Workflows">

1. Create a new Kubernetes secret named `dagger-cloud` and set it to the value of the token obtained in [Step 1](#step-1-sign-up-for-dagger-cloud). An example command to achieve this is shown below (replace the `TOKEN` placeholder with your actual token value). Refer to the Kubernetes documentation [on creating secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic dagger-cloud --from-literal=token=TOKEN
    ```

1. Update your Argo Workflows specification and add the secret as an environment variable. The environment variable must be named `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN`.

    [See an example of a sample Argo Workflows specification](../../../integrations/533927-argo-workflows.mdx)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Visualize your pipeline runs with Dagger Cloud

:::info
At the end of this step, you will have data from one or more CI or local runs available for inspection and debugging in Dagger Cloud.
:::

### Trigger runs from your local development host

:::info Best practices for visualizing local runs in Dagger Cloud
Dagger Cloud uses metadata from your version control system (VCS), such as Git, to populate some information in the user interface. Therefore, you should run your Dagger pipelines within a VCS context, such as a local directory linked to a cloned Git repository.
:::

Before completing these steps, ensure you've [added your Dagger Cloud token as an environment variable](#connect-from-your-local-development-host).

1. In your terminal, call the Dagger Module. If your environment variable is properly defined, you will see a Dagger Cloud URL printed in the terminal.
1. Click on the URL to view details of the run in Dagger Cloud.

To see this in action, commit a change to your forked and locally-cloned Dagger repository and call the Go builder module to build it.

```shell
echo "test on local host" >> README.md
git commit -a -m "Updated README"
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.8 call build --source=. --args=./cmd/dagger
```

:::info Multiple Dagger Cloud organizations
To use Dagger Cloud locally with multiple organizations, you must set distinct environment variables for each organization's Dagger Cloud token. You can find the unique token for an organization in the **Organization Settings** page.
:::

### Trigger runs from your CI engine

Once your CI provider/tool is connected with Dagger Cloud, it's time to test the integration.

To do this, trigger your CI workflow by pushing a commit or opening a pull request. If you are working with a forked and locally-cloned Dagger repository, use the following commands:

```shell
echo "test on Dagger Cloud" >> README.md
git commit -a -m "Updated README"
git push
```

### Visualize a run

Dagger Cloud lets you visualize your Dagger pipelines in two ways: runs and changes.

#### Runs

A run is an invocation of a Dagger pipeline. When you run Dagger in CI, each call aligns with one run in Dagger Cloud. If you have many CI jobs configured to run for every pull/merge request, you may see several runs for a single commit.

For instance, if 4 GitHub Actions workflows each call Dagger to run a pipeline for pull requessts, you will see four distinct runs in the Dagger Cloud UI. You may also see multiple runs if one GitHub workflow has multiple jobs defined with distinct calls to Dagger to run your pipelines. As you Daggerize your pipelines, you will likely have fewer distinct CI workflows.

Because Dagger Cloud understands the Dagger engine's data model, it gives you visibility into the steps of your pipeline's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), including detailed logs for each step.

##### All Runs page

Navigate to the **All Runs** page of the Dagger Cloud dashboard. You should see your most recent run as the first entry in the table, as shown below:

![View runs](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/get-started/view-runs.png)

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each run.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status | Indication of run success or failure |
|Title | Title of the pull request or Change or commit title (abbreviated) |
|Commit |Git commit ID |
|Change | Reference to the pull request or merge request your in source code repository |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |
|User | User triggering the run |
|Runner Job | Run ID (first 8 identifying bytes) |
|Branch | Name of the branch in source code repository |
|Remote | Full path to the remote source code repository |

:::tip
You can display a subset of runs, such as runs related to a specific commit, branch, user or remote, by clicking the *Filter* icon in the corresponding field of the run list.
:::

##### Run Details page

You can drill down into the details of a specific run by clicking it. This directs you to a run-specific *Run Details* page. When you run Dagger locally, this is the page you visit when you click the Dagger Cloud link in the CLI output.

![View run details](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/get-started/view-run-details-tree.png)

The *Run Details* page includes detailed status and duration metadata about the pipeline steps. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and steps within those pipelines. If there are any errors in the run, Dagger Cloud automatically brings you to the first error in the list. You see detailed logs and output of each step, making it easy for you to debug your pipelines and collaborate with your teammates.

When the run is performed in a Git context, the Dagger Cloud UI shows the VCS Git metadata associated with the commit.

![Run with metadata](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/get-started/run-git-metadata.png)

When the run takes place outside of a Git context, Dagger Cloud will show the same detailed steps. However, the top-level metadata will not be populated.

![Run, no metadata](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/get-started/run-no-metadata.png)

##### Run Details: Step viewer

Clicking into a specific step will open a drawer with several elements that can help you debug why your pipeline is failing and help you identify why a step might not have been cached.

![View step details](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/user-interface/step-details.png)

:::note
The Dagger team is working on a new user experience to group your Dagger runs by the pull or merge request (group commits by PR/MR).
:::

#### Changes

A change is a group of runs for a specific commit or pull/merge request.

##### All Changes page

The *All Changes* page lists available groups.

![View changes](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/user-interface/all-changes.png)

Here's a quick summary of what you'll see for each change.

|Field | Description |
|---|---|
|Status | Indication of run success or failure |
|Title | Change or commit title (abbreviated) |
|Commit | Commit ID |
|Change | Reference to change in source code repository |
|Start | Run start time |
|Duration | Run duration |
|User | User triggering the run |
|Runner Job | Run ID (first 8 identifying bytes) |
|Branch | Name of the branch in source code repository |
|Remote | Full path to the remote source code repository |


##### Change Details page

You can drill down into the details of a specific change by clicking it. This directs you to a *Change Details* page, as shown below:

![View change details](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/user-interface/change-details.png)

The *Change Details* page lists all the pipeline runs for the commit or pull request. The tree view shows Dagger pipelines and detailed logs of steps and outputs within those pipelines. Clicking into a run takes you to the [run's details page](user-interface#run-details-page).

## Step 4: Use cache volumes with the experimental Dagger Cloud cache

:::info
At the end of this step, you will have integrated Dagger Cloud's experimental distributed cache with your workflows.
:::

:::info
Dagger Cloud's distributed caching feature is only available under the **Team** plan.
:::

One of Dagger's most powerful features is its ability to cache data across pipeline runs. This is especially useful when dealing with package managers such as `npm`, `maven`, `pip` and similar. For these tools to cache properly, they need their own cache data (usually a directory) to be persisted between runs. Since these dependencies are usually locked to specific versions in the application's manifest, re-downloading them on every pipeline run is inefficient and time-consuming.

Dagger comes with built-in support to define one or more such directories as cache volumes and persist their contents across runs. Dagger Cloud enhances caching support significantly and allows cross-host synchronization of cache volumes. This allows multiple machines, including ephemeral runners, to intelligently share a distributed cache.

Dagger Cloud automatically detects and creates cache volumes when they are declared in your code. The Go builder module used in this guide already declares two cache volumes, named `gomodcache` and `gobuildcache`. To see them in action, trigger your CI workflow by pushing a commit or opening a pull request.

:::info
If you've configured cache volumes for the first time in a local development environment, call your Dagger Module via the Dagger CLI and then run the command `docker container stop -t 300 "$(docker container list --filter 'name=^dagger-engine-*' -q)"`. This step ensures your new cache volumes populate to Dagger Cloud as these are during the engine shutdown phase. You only need to do this the first time you use Dagger Cloud locally with cache volumes or when you add new cache volumes in your Dagger pipeline.
:::

To see your cache volumes, browse to the **Organization Settings** page of Dagger Cloud dashboard (accessible by clicking your user profile icon in the Dagger Cloud interface) and navigate to the **Configuration** tab. You should see the newly-created volumes listed and enabled.

:::note
Your cache volumes will appear in the UI within a few minutes after your pipeline run has completed. If you don't see them in the UI, ensure you've referenced the volumes correctly in your Dagger Module code and that you've set up your CI or local development workflows to push the cache volumes to Dagger Cloud.
:::

![Manage volumes](/img/current_docs/manuals/user/cloud/get-started/manage-volumes.png)

You can create as many volumes as needed and manage them from the **Configuration** tab of your Dagger Cloud organization page.

## Conclusion

This guide introduced you to Dagger Cloud and walked you through registering a new organization, integrating Dagger Cloud with your CI provider/tool, and using Dagger Cloud's visualization and caching features.
