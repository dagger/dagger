The next step is to create a repository in Google Artifact Registry. This repository will host the built container image of the application.

1. From the navigation menu, select the `CI/CD` -> `Artifact Registry` product.
1. Select the `Repositories` category.
1. Select the `Create Repository` option.
1. Configure the repository with the following inputs, modifying them as needed:

    - Format: `Docker`
    - Mode: `Standard`
    - Location type: `Region`
    - Encryption: `Google-managed encryption key`
    - Cleanup policy: `Delete artifacts`

1. Click `Create` to create the repository.

The new repository is created. The Google Cloud Console displays the repository in the repository index page. Click the repository name to view details, including its public URL, as shown below:

:::note
This guide assumes a project named `myproject` and a repository named `myrepository in the `us-central1` region. These repository details are used as arguments to the Dagger functions in this guide; remember to update them based on the inputs you provided when creating the repository.
