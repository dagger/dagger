The `dagger` CLI is available for installation on macOS, Linux, and Windows to run locally or in a CI environment.
:::

Install the `dagger` CLI following the steps below.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="macOS">

We assume that you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. If you do, you can install `dagger` with a single command:

```shell
brew install dagger/tap/dagger
```

This installs `dagger` in:

```shell
type dagger
# macOS ARM:
dagger is /opt/homebrew/bin/dagger
# macOS Intel:
dagger is /usr/local/bin/dagger
```

If you do not have Homebrew installed, or you want to install a specific version of `dagger`, you can run:

```shell
cd /usr/local
curl -L https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | DAGGER_VERSION=0.11.9 sh

./bin/dagger version
dagger v0.11.9 (registry.dagger.io/engine) darwin/arm64
```

If your user account doesn't have sufficient privileges to install in `/usr/local` and `sudo` is available, use the following command instead:

```shell
cd /usr/local
curl -L https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | DAGGER_VERSION=0.11.9 sudo sh
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Linux">

The quickest way of installing `dagger` on Linux is to run the following command:

```shell
curl -L https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin sh
```

This installs `dagger` in `$HOME/.local/bin`:

```shell
type dagger
dagger is $HOME/.local/bin/dagger
```

If you want to install a specific version of `dagger`, you can run:

```shell
curl -L https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | DAGGER_VERSION=0.11.9 sh

./bin/dagger version
dagger v0.11.9 (registry.dagger.io/engine) linux/amd64
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows">

`dagger` can be installed on Windows via a PowerShell 7.0 script.

The quickest way of installing `dagger` on Windows is to run the following command:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression; Install-Dagger
```

To install Dagger to a custom location, specify the location using the `-InstallPath` parameter.

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression;
Install-Dagger -InstallPath C:\tools\dagger
```

To install a specific version of Dagger, specify the version with the `-DaggerVersion` parameter.

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression;
Install-Dagger -DaggerVersion 0.11.9
```

For an interactive installation process, include the `-Interactive` switch.

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression; 
Install-Dagger -Interactive
```

For further customization, such as adding Dagger to your system's PATH, additional parameters are available. To view all available options:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.ps1 | Invoke-Expression; 
Get-Command -Name Install-Dagger -Syntax
```

By default, without specifying the `-InstallPath`, Dagger will be installed in the `<your home folder>\dagger` directory.

To verify that Dagger has been installed correctly, use where.exe

```powershell
where.exe dagger
# Expected output: C:\<your home folder>\dagger\dagger.exe
```
