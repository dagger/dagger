# Quickstart

## Use modules from the Daggerverse

As you've seen in previous sections, modules can be consumed from remote sources like GitHub, or installed and used locally. The [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev) is an online catalog of Dagger modules that enables users to easily discover and use modules created by the Dagger community.

All Dagger CLI commands work as expected with Daggerverse URLs. Here are a few more examples for you to try:

- [Publish a container to the ttlsh registry](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/shykes/daggerverse/ttlsh): `dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/ttlsh call publish --ctr=alpine:latest`
- [Play a game of yamlinvaders](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders): `dagger -m github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders call play terminal`
- [Stitch videos together](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/marcosnils/daggerverse/videostitch): `wget -q https://download.samplelib.com/mp4/sample-5s.mp4 && wget -q https://download.samplelib.com/mp4/sample-10s.mp4 && dagger -m github.com/marcosnils/daggerverse/videostitch@main call -o output.mp4 stitch --src-dir=.`
- [Scan a container image for vulnerabilities](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy): `dagger -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy scan-image call --image-ref=alpine/git:latest`
