# Quickstart

## Find functions on the Daggerverse

As you've seen in previous sections, functions are designed to be easily shared and reused: all you need it the git URL of a module, and you can call all the functions from that module.

But how to find useful modules? Enter *the Daggerverse*.

The [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev) is a free service run by Dagger, which indexes all publicly available Dagger modules, and lets you easily search and consume them.

Using the Daggerverse, you can easily discover great modules being developed by the community, learn how they work, and start using them. Since modules are just source code, it's easy to contribute to them, too!

Using the Daggerverse is optional, and does not change how you use Dagger. If you find a module you like, simply copy its URL, and use it the usual way.

Here are a few modules to explore:

- [Publish a container to the ttlsh registry](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/shykes/daggerverse/ttlsh): `dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/ttlsh call publish --ctr=alpine:latest`
- [Play a game of yamlinvaders](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders): `dagger -m github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders call play terminal`
- [Stitch videos together](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/marcosnils/daggerverse/videostitch): `wget -q https://download.samplelib.com/mp4/sample-5s.mp4 && wget -q https://download.samplelib.com/mp4/sample-10s.mp4 && dagger -m github.com/marcosnils/daggerverse/videostitch@main call -o output.mp4 stitch --src-dir=.`
- [Scan a container image for vulnerabilities](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy): `dagger -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy scan-image call --image-ref=alpine/git:latest`
