# Quickstart

## Initialize a Dagger module

Begin Daggerizing the project by initializing a new Dagger module at the project's root directory. Use the following command:

```shell
dagger init
```

You should see a new file at the root of your repository, named `dagger.json`. View its contents. You should see the following:

```json
```

:::tip
By default, the module name is derived from the name of the directory in which it is initialized. To use a different name, add the `--name` argument to the `dagger init` call, such as `dagger init --name=my-module`.
:::

Now that you have a Dagger module, you can install other modules into it, as dependencies. This allows you to reuse functionality developed by others, without needing to write any code yourself. In this case, since the goal is to build a CI pipeline for a Go application, it makes sense to install the Golang module from the Daggerverse.

Use the following command to install the module:

```shell
dagger install github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang@v0.1.8
```

Once the command completes, look at the `dagger.json` file again. You should see the newly-added dependency in it, similar to that shown below:

```json

```

:::tip
The exact Git commit for the module version is recorded in `dagger.json`. Dagger enforces version pinning, which guarantees that the module version you install is the one you'll be using.
