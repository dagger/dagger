# Quickstart

## Call your first function

You're now ready to dive into Dagger and call your first function! Use the following command:


```shell
dagger -m golang call test --source=.
```

Here's what you should see:

```
OK
```

Well done! You've just called your first Dagger function!

In this example, Dagger loaded a module directly from its GitHub repository, and executed the function `test` from that module. If you [inspect the source code of the module](#), you'll see a `Test()` function, written in Go, which internally runs `go test`.

:::info
When using `dagger call`, all names (functions, arguments, fields, etc) are converted into a shell-friendly "kebab-case" style. This is why the function named `Hello()` is invoked as `dagger call hello`.
:::

Dagger Functions, just like regular functions, can accept arguments. Appending the `--help` flag to a `dagger call` command will display a context-sensitive list of supported arguments and sub-commands.

Inspect the arguments of the `test` function you called earlier:

```shell
dagger -m golang call test --help
```

FIXME: Add more info
