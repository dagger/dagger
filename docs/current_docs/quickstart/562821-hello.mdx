# Quickstart

## Call your first function

Before you can start using Dagger, here are a few important concepts to know.

- To use Dagger, you call Dagger Functions. Dagger Functions are regular code, written in a supported programming language, and run in containers. Dagger Functions let you encapsulate common operations or workflows into discrete units with clear inputs and outputs.
- The Dagger Engine provides some core functions, but you are encouraged to write your own and share them with others. Dagger also lets you import and reuse modules developed by your team, your organization or the broader Dagger community. Functions are packaged, shared and reused using modules.
- You can call functions from external modules in exactly the same way as you would call core functions. The simplest and most common way is to use the Dagger CLI, which you installed in the previous section. The Dagger CLI is a full-featured, easy to use tool that can be used interactively from a terminal or non-interactively from a shell script or a CI configuration. But Dagger Functions can also be called from other Dagger Functions (more on this later).
- Modules don't need to be installed locally. Dagger lets you consume modules from GitHub repositories as well.

You're now ready to dive into Dagger and call your first function! Use the following command:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello
```

Here's what you should see:

```
hello, world!
```

Well done! You've just called your first Dagger function!

As you can see, Dagger loaded a module directly from its GitHub repository, and executed the function `hello` from that module.

If you [inspect the source code of the module](https://github.com/shykes/daggerverse/blob/main/hello/main.go), you'll see a `Hello()` function, written in Go, which prepares a message and returns it as a string.

:::info
When using `dagger call`, all names (functions, arguments, fields, etc) are converted into a shell-friendly "kebab-case" style. This is why the function named `Hello()` is invoked as `dagger call hello`.
:::

### List available function arguments

Dagger Functions, just like regular functions, can accept arguments. Appending the `--help` flag to a `dagger call` command will display a context-sensitive list of supported arguments and sub-commands.

Inspect the arguments of the `hello` function you called earlier:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello --help
```

You should see output that looks like this:

```shell
Say hello to the world!

Usage:
  dagger call hello [flags]

Flags:
       --figlet-container Container   Optional container for running the figlet tool
       --giant                        Encode the message in giant multi-character letters
       --greeting string              An optional greeting (default is "hello")
       --name string                  An optional name (default is "world")
       --shout                        Make the message uppercase, and add more exclamation
                                      points
```

### Call a function with arguments

Let's pass two string arguments to the `hello` function, from the list above:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello --greeting=bonjour --name=daggernaut
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
bonjour, daggernaut!
```

### Use complex types as arguments

In addition to basic types (string, boolean, integer, array...), Dagger also defines powerful core types which functions can use as arguments: `Directory`, `File`, `Container`, `Service`, `Secret` and others.

You'll see this in action as you continue through the quickstart, but here's a quick example that demonstrates passing a `Directory` type as argument to a Dagger Function:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/vikram-dagger/daggerverse/fileutils call tree --dir='https://github.com/dagger/dagger#main:cmd/dagger'
```

Here, the `Tree()` function accepts a `Directory` as argument and returns a tree representation of that directory. The directory could be a local directory, or a remote Git reference. In this example, the directory is the `cmd/dagger` sub-directory of Dagger's open-source GitHub repository.

You should see the following output, which should be the same file listing as [this GitHub page](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/main/cmd/dagger):

:::tip
All of Dagger's core types, such as `Directory`, `File`, `Container`, `Service`, `Secret`, can be used as arguments by Dagger Functions. These core types are not merely strings referencing local or remote resources; they are actual representations of the corresponding resource states, managed by the Dagger Engine, and passed to and between Dagger Functions like other variables. This feature makes it easy to assemble complex pipelines where container state flows from function to function, in just a few lines of code.
