# Quickstart

## Build a container with a function

Just as you can chain and return `Directory` types, you can also chain and return `Container` types in functions.

### Call a builder function

Try calling this function:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.2 call container --packages=python3
```

This Wolfi container builder module exposes a `Container()` function that returns a base Wolfi container image, and accepts arguments to additional packages in the base image;

You can use this function to build and return a Wolfi container image containing specific packages - in this example, the `python3` package. You should see the container being built and the packages being added, as shown below:

```shell
Container evaluated. Use "dagger call base with-package container --help" to see available sub-commands.
```

This means that the build succeeded, and a `Container` type representing the built container image was returned. And, like `Directory`, `Container` is a Dagger core type which comes with useful functions of its own.

### Start an interactive terminal session with the container

One of the most interesting `Container` functions is `Terminal()`, which can be used to open an interactive terminal session with the container. This feature is very useful for debugging and experimenting since it allows you to interact with containers directly and at any stage of your Dagger function execution.

To see this in action, call the previous function again, this time chaining an additional function call to `Terminal()` on the returned `Container`:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.2 call \
  container --packages=python3 terminal
```

This revised command builds the container image and then drops you into an interactive terminal, allowing you to directly execute commands in the running container.

Verify this by executing the following command:

```shell
python3 -c "print('Hello from Dagger')"
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
Hello from Dagger
```

:::caution
While most terminal programs such as `htop` or `vim` work with `dagger ... terminal`, you may experience visual bugs with some programs due to terminal emulator incompatibilities.

### Execute commands in the container

The `Container` type has a `WithExec()` function, which returns the container after executing a specific command inside it. So, you could achieve the same result as before (although non-interactively) by chaining function calls to `WithExec()` and `Stdout()` on the `Container` returned previously, as shown in the following command:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.2 call \
  container --packages=python3 \
  with-exec --args=python3,-c,"print('Hello from Dagger')" \
  stdout
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
Hello from Dagger
```

### Publish the container image to a registry

The `Container` type also makes a number of other functions available. To see some of these in action, call the previous function again, chaining additional function calls to `WithEntrypoint()` and `Publish()` on the returned `Container` to, respectively, set the container entrypoint command and publish it to a registry:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi@v0.1.2 call \
  container --packages=python3 \
  with-entrypoint --args=python3,-c,"print('Hello from Dagger')" \
  publish --address ttl.sh/dagger-$RANDOM
```

The output will be a container image reference on the [ttl.sh container registry](https://ttl.sh), as shown below:

```shell
ttl.sh/dagger-10939@sha256:57c15999fdc59df452161f648aaa9b9a1ea9dbda710a0a0242f509966a286b4b
```

Test the container image using the command below (remember to update the image reference based on the function output):

```shell
docker run --rm ttl.sh/dagger-10939
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
Hello from Dagger
```
