# Add an AI agent to an Existing Project

Now that you've learned the basics of creating an AI agent with Dagger in [Built an AI agent](./index.mdx), its time to apply those lessons to a more realistic use case. In this guide, you will build an AI agent that builds features for an existing project.

For this guide you will start with a Daggerized project. The agent will use the Dagger functions in this project that are already used locally and in CI for testing the project.

## Requirements

This quickstart will take you approximately 10 minutes to complete. You should ideally have completed the AI agent and CI quickstart and should be familiar with programming in Go, Python, TypeScript, PHP, or Java.
Before beginning, ensure that:

- you have [installed the Dagger CLI](../../install.mdx).
- You have [configured](../../configuration/llm.mdx) an LLM provider to use with Dagger
- You have completed the [AI agent quickstart](./index.mdx) to learn the basics of LLMs in Dagger
- You have completed the [CI quickstart](../ci/index.mdx) to a Daggerize a project

## Inspect the example application

This quickstart uses the [Daggerized project from the CI quickstart](../ci/index.mdx). To verify that your project is in the correct state, change to the project's working directory and list the available Dagger Functions:

```shell
cd hello-dagger
dagger functions
```

This should show:

```
Name        Description
build       Build the application container
build-env   Build a ready-to-use development environment
publish     Publish the application container after building and testing it on-the-fly
test        Return the result of running unit tests
```

## Create a workspace for the agent

The goal of this quickstart is to create an agent to interact with the existing codebase and add features to it. This means that the agent needs the ability to list, read and write files in the project directory.

To give the agent these tools, create a Dagger submodule called `workspace`. This module will have Dagger Functions to list, read, and write files. The agent can use these Dagger Functions to interact with the codebase. By giving the agent a module with a limited set of tools, the agent has less room for error and will be more successful at its tasks.

    <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">
    Start by creating the submodule:

    ```

    Replace the `.dagger/workspace/src/index.ts` file with the following contents:
    ```typescript file=./snippets/part2/workspace/typescript/src/index.ts
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    Start by creating the submodule:

    ```shell
    dagger init --sdk=php .dagger/workspace
    ```

    Replace the `.dagger/workspace/src/Workspace.php` file with the following contents:
    ```php file=./snippets/part2/workspace/php/src/Workspace.php
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
    Start by creating the submodule:

    ```shell
    dagger init --sdk=java .dagger/workspace
    ```

    Replace the `.dagger/workspace/src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/workspace/Workspace.java` file with the following contents:
    ```java file=./snippets/part2/workspace/java/src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/workspace/Workspace.java
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this Dagger module, each Dagger Function performs a different operation:
- The `read-file` Dagger Function reads a file in the workspace.
- The `write-file` Dagger Function writes a file to the workspace.
- The `list-files` Dagger Function lists all the files in the workspace.
- The `get-source` Dagger Function gets the source code directory from the workspace.

See the functions of the new workspace module:

```shell
dagger -m .dagger/workspace functions
```

Now install the new submodule as a dependency to the main module:

```shell
dagger install ./.dagger/workspace
```

## Create an agentic function

This agent will make changes to the application and use the existing `test` function from the Daggerized CI pipeline to validate the changes.

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString="sdk">
    <TabItem value="go" label="Go">
        Add the following new function to the main dagger module in `.dagger/main.go`:

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
        Add the following new function to the main dagger module in `.dagger/src/hello_dagger/main.py`:

        ```python file=./snippets/part2/agent/python/agent.py.snippet

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="typescript" label="Typescript">
        Add the following new function to the main dagger module in `.dagger/src/index.ts`:

        ```typescript file=./snippets/part2/agent/typescript/agent.ts.snippet
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    Add the following new function to the main dagger module in `.dagger/src/HelloDagger.php`:

    ```php file=./snippets/part2/agent/php/agent.php.snippet
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        Add the following new function to the main dagger module in `.dagger/src/main/java/io/dagger/modules/hellodagger/HelloDagger.java`:

        ```java file=./snippets/part2/agent/java/agent.java.snippet
        ```

        Be sure to add imports for the following:

        ```Java
import io.dagger.client.Client;
import io.dagger.client.Env;
import io.dagger.client.File;
import io.dagger.client.LLM;
import io.dagger.client.Workspace;
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This code creates a Dagger Function called `develop` that takes an assignment and codebase as input and returns a `Directory` with the modified codebase containing the completed assignment.

There are a few important points to note here:
- The variable `environment` is the environment to define inputs and outputs for the agent. Each input and output provides a description which acts as a declarative form of prompting.
- Other Dagger module dependencies are automatically detected and made available for use in this environment. In this example, Dagger finds the `workspace` sub-module installed and automatically generates bindings for it: `with-workspace-input` and `with-workspace-output`. These bindings can be used to provide (or retrieve) the workspace to the agent.
- The `environment` is privileged, which means that the environment includes all the Dagger Functions in the existing Daggerized CI pipeline, plus the core Dagger API. This allows the agent to use the existing `test` function to run unit tests.
- The LLM is supplied with a prompt file instead of an inline prompt. By separating the prompt from the Dagger Function code, it becomes easier to maintain and update the instructions given to the LLM.
- The `Env` in this agent is privileged, which means the environment will also include the current module and core Dagger APIs. This allows the agent to use the existing `test` function.

The final step is to add the prompt file. Create a file at `.dagger/develop_prompt.md` with the following content:

```
You are a developer on the HelloDagger Vue.js project.
You will be given an assignment and the tools to complete the assignment.
Your assignment is: $assignment

## Constraints
- Before writing code, analyze the Workspace to understand the project.
- Do not make unneccessary changes.
- Run tests with the HelloDagger Test tool.
- You must pass the Directory from the Workspace_get_source to the Test tool.
- Always run tests to validate your code changes.
- Do not stop until you have completed the assignment and the tests pass.
```

This prompt is longer and more structured than the prompt from the first quickstart. The tasks the agent will be asked to complete will be more complex because its making modifications to an existing codebase and will need to understand more context. To create a reliable agent that can operate with more complexity, the prompt structure and tools are extremely important.

## Run the agent

Now its time to run the new agent. Enter Dagger shell by running `dagger`, and then:

Check the help text for the new Dagger Function:
```shell
.help develop
```

This should show how to use the `develop` function.

Make sure your LLM provider has been properly configured:

```shell
llm | model
```

This should show the model you've configured to use with your provider.

Call the agent with an assignment:

```shell
develop "make the main page green"
```

If all goes well, the agent will explore the project to find the correct place to make the changes, write the appropriate changes, and then validate them by calling the `test` function.

:::tip
If the agent misbehaves, try providing more guidance in the prompt file based on what went wrong.

Since the agent returns a `Directory`, use Dagger Shell to do more with that `Directory`. For example:

```shell
# Save the directory containing the completed assignment to a variable
completed=$(develop "make the main page green")
# Get a terminal in the build container with the directory
build-env --source $completed | terminal
# Run the app with the updated source code
build --source $completed | as-service | up --ports 8080:80
# Save the changes to your filesystem
$completed | export .
```
