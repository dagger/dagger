# Quickstart

## Daggerize the application's build

If your application passes all its tests, the typical next step is to build it. Let's add a new Dagger Function to create a production build of the example application.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

Update the `dagger/main.go` file with the following code:

```go file=./snippets/build/go/main.go
```

This Dagger Function does many of the same things as the previous one, but with these modifications:

- It modifies the command passed to the `Container().WithExec()` method, changing it to `npm run build`.
  - The `npm run build` command builds the application and places the build in a `dist/` directory in the container filesystem.
- It uses the `Container().Directory()` method to return the directory as Dagger's special `Directory` type. This is called a "just-in-time" directory - a transient artifact produced as the result of a Dagger Function.

Update the `dagger/src/main/__init__.py` file with the following code:

```python file=./snippets/build/python/__init__.py
```

This Dagger Function does many of the same things as the previous one, but with these modifications:

- It modifies the command passed to the `container().with_exec()` method, changing it to `npm run build`.
  - The `npm run build` command builds the application and places the build in a `dist/` directory in the container filesystem.
- It uses the `container().directory()` method to return the directory as Dagger's special `Directory` type. This is called a "just-in-time" directory - a transient artifact produced as the result of a Dagger Function.

Update the `dagger/src/index.ts` file with the following code:

```typescript file=./snippets/build/typescript/index.ts
```

This Dagger Function does many of the same things as the previous one, but with these modifications:

- It modifies the command passed to the `container().withExec()` method, changing it to `npm run build`.
  - The `npm run build` command builds the application and places the build in a `dist/` directory in the container filesystem.
- It uses the `container().directory()` method to return the directory as Dagger's special `Directory` type. This is called a "just-in-time" directory - a transient artifact produced as the result of a Dagger Function.

Call the Dagger Function:

```shell
dagger call \
  build --source=.
```

You should see various operations taking place, ending with this output:

```
Directory evaluated. Use "dagger call build --help" to see available sub-commands.
```

This means that the build succeeded, and a directory was returned as a `Directory` type.

At this point, the Dagger Function has produced a directory with a production build of the application. However, since Dagger Functions execute within containers spawned by the Dagger Engine, this build directory is only available in the container, not on the host from where you ran `dagger call`. It must therefore be explicitly transferred or exported from the container to the host before you can use it.

Just-in-time filesystem artifacts like `Directory` and `File` include a method to export them to the host filesystem. To see this in action, revise the previous `dagger call` command and chain an `export` function call to it:

```shell
dagger call \
  build --source=. \
  export --path=./build
```

This command exports the directory returned by the `build` Dagger Function to a custom path (`./build`) on the host. The destination path on the host is passed to the function using the `--path` flag. Inspect this directory and you should see the production build of the application:

```
ls -R build/
./build/:
assets  favicon.ico  index.html

./build/assets:
AboutView-C6Dx7pxG.css  AboutView-CEwcYZ3g.js  index-CfPjtpcd.js  index-D6pr4OYR.css
```

:::tip FUNCTION CHAINING
Function chaining works the same way, whether you're writing Dagger Function code using a Dagger SDK or invoking a Dagger Function using the Dagger CLI. The following are equivalent:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">
```go

// Exports a directory with the production build to the host
func (m *HelloDagger) BuildWithExport(source *Directory) *Directory {
	return dag.Container().
		From("node:21-slim").
		WithDirectory("/src", source.WithoutDirectory("dagger")).
		WithWorkdir("/src").
		WithExec([]string{"npm", "install"}).
		WithExec([]string{"npm", "run", "build"}).
		Directory("./dist").
		Export("./build")
}
```
