# Quickstart

## Daggerize the application's build

If your application passes all its tests, the typical next step is to build it. Let's add a new Dagger Function to create a production build of the example application.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

Update the `dagger/main.go` file with the following code:

```go file=./snippets/build/go/main.go
```

This Dagger Function does many of the same things as the previous one, but with these modifications:

- It modifies the command passed to the `Container().WithExec()` method, changing it to `npm run build`.
  - The `npm run build` command builds the application and places the build in a `dist/` directory in the container filesystem.
- It uses the `Container().Directory()` method to return the directory as Dagger's special `Directory` type.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

Update the `dagger/src/main/__init__.py` file with the following code:

```python file=./snippets/build/python/__init__.py
```

This Dagger Function does many of the same things as the previous one, but with these modifications:

- It modifies the command passed to the `container().with_exec()` method, changing it to `npm run build`.
  - The `npm run build` command builds the application and places the build in a `dist/` directory in the container filesystem.
- It uses the `container().directory()` method to return the directory as Dagger's special `Directory` type.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

Update the `dagger/src/index.ts` file with the following code:

```typescript file=./snippets/build/typescript/index.ts
```

This Dagger Function does many of the same things as the previous one, but with these modifications:

- It modifies the command passed to the `container().withExec()` method, changing it to `npm run build`.
  - The `npm run build` command builds the application and places the build in a `dist/` directory in the container filesystem.
- It uses the `container().directory()` method to return the directory as Dagger's special `Directory` type.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Call the Dagger Function:

```shell
dagger call \
  build --source=.
```

You should see various operations taking place, ending with this output:

```
Directory evaluated. Use "dagger call build --help" to see available sub-commands.
```

This means that the build succeeded, and a directory containing a production build of the application was returned as a `Directory` type. This is a ["just-in-time" directory](../manuals/user/artifacts/production/582201-directories.mdx) - a [transient artifact](../manuals/user/artifacts/723090-artifacts.mdx) produced as the result of a Dagger Function.

However, since [Dagger Functions execute within containers spawned by the Dagger Engine](../manuals/developer/overview/942201-execution-environment.mdx), this build directory is only available in the container, not on the host from where you ran `dagger call`. It must therefore be explicitly transferred or exported from the container to the host before you can use it.

Just-in-time filesystem artifacts like `Directory` and `File` include a method to [export them to the host filesystem](../manuals/user/artifacts/consumption/273920-export.mdx). To see this in action, revise the previous `dagger call` command and chain an `export` function call to it:

```shell
dagger call \
  build --source=. \
  export --path=./build
```

This command exports the directory returned by the `build` Dagger Function to a custom path (`./build`) on the host. The destination path on the host is passed to the function using the `--path` flag. Inspect this directory and you should see the production build of the application:

```
ls -R build/
./build/:
assets  favicon.ico  index.html

./build/assets:
AboutView-C6Dx7pxG.css  AboutView-CEwcYZ3g.js  index-CfPjtpcd.js  index-D6pr4OYR.css
```

:::tip FUNCTION CHAINING
[Function chaining](../manuals/user/functions/539201-chaining.mdx) works the same way, whether you're writing Dagger Function code using a Dagger SDK or invoking a Dagger Function using the Dagger CLI. The following are equivalent:
