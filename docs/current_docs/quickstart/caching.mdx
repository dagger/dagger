# Quickstart

## Speed up the pipeline with caching

One of Dagger's most powerful features is its ability to cache data across Dagger Function runs. This is typically most useful when dealing with package managers such as `npm`, `maven`, `pip` and similar. For these tools to cache properly, they need their own cache data (usually a directory) to be persisted between runs.

Dagger lets you define one or more such directories as cache volumes and persist their contents across runs. This enables you to reuse the contents of the cache volume(s) every time the pipeline runs, and thereby speed up pipeline operations.

:::caution
Cache volumes are not meant to be shared outside of Dagger; they are for persisting specific parts of the internal state of your pipeline, for optimal use of your tool's native caching features.
:::

You may have noticed that the example pipeline executes the `npm install` command to download the application's dependencies every time it runs. Since these dependencies are usually locked to specific versions in the application's manifest, re-downloading them on every pipeline run is inefficient and time-consuming.

This step is, therefore, a good candidate for a cache volume. Let's update the pipeline accordingly.


:::tip CACHING
In addition to cache volumes, Dagger has a separate cache for pipeline operations. Changes in cache volumes or secrets do not invalidate the Dagger pipeline operations cache.
