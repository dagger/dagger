# Quickstart

## Complete the pipeline

So far, you've been calling individual Dagger Functions using the Dagger CLI. But what if you want to combine multiple Dagger Function calls?

There are various reasons you might want to do this. A common example is that when developing locally, it's quicker and easier to trigger your test-build-package pipeline using a single command (`dagger call ci ...`) instead of multiple commands (`dagger call test ... && dagger call build ... && dagger call package ...`).

One option to do this is to stitch together `dagger call` commands using the CLI and a shell script or a Makefile. However, this approach is not recommended, because you will typically end up with long and unwieldy CLI commands and shell scripting "glue" that is hard to debug and maintain.

A better approach is to create a "master" Dagger Function, which can then orchestrate other Dagger Functions as required. Using a programming language to stitch together Dagger Functions in this way has multiple benefits:
- It improves maintainability, because it encourages you to transform your workflows into structured, discrete and composable units with clear inputs and outputs.
- It removes environment-related variance which can destabilize shell scripts in unexpected ways and makes the pipeline more relaible.
- It promotes closer adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- It improves the development experience, because it opens up access to the programming language's existing ecosystem and tooling.

Update the generated `dagger/main.go` file and create a new Dagger Function which internally uses the three Dagger Functions created in previous sections:

```go file=./snippets/ci/go/main.go
```

This Dagger Function expects a `Directory` as argument. It performs the following operations:

- It calls the `Test()` Dagger Function to run the application's test anD return` the results.
- It calls the `Build()` Dagger Function to build the application and return the build output directory.
- It calls the `Package()` Dagger Function to build and return a container image of the application.
- It calls the `Container().Publish()` method to publish the container image to the registry and return the image identifier.

Call the Dagger Function to run the pipeline and publish the containerized application to the [ttl.sh container registry](https://ttl.sh):

```shell
dagger call ci \
  --source=.
```

You should see the application being tested, built, packaged and published. The final result will be an image reference on the [ttl.sh container registry](https://ttl.sh), as in the previous step.
