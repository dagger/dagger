# Quickstart

## Conclusion

Over the last few pages, this quickstart has walked you through the process of creating a CI pipeline to test, build, package and release an example application using Dagger. It has taught you key Dagger concepts and introduced you to Dagger API, the Dagger CLI, Dagger Functions and the Daggerverse.

Where do you go next?

- Once you've Daggerized your application's pipeline, the next step is to transfer and run it from your CI provider/tool. Understand how to integrate Dagger with [GitHub Actions](../integrations/642920-github-actions.mdx), [GitLab CI](../integrations/734201-gitlab.mdx), [CircleCI](../integrations/592501-circleci.mdx), [Jenkins](../integrations/322019-jenkins.mdx), [Azure Pipelines](../integrations/197291-azure-pipelines.mdx), [AWS CodeBuild](../integrations/963919-aws-codebuild.mdx), [Argo Workflows](../integrations/533927-argo-workflows.mdx) and [Tekton](../integrations/728101-tekton.mdx).
- The Dagger CLI is the easiest way to work with Dagger Functions. Learn more about the Dagger CLI and see supported commands in the [Dagger CLI reference](../reference/979596-cli.mdx).
- Function chaining and just-in-time artifacts are important concepts introduced in this quickstart. Explore these and other key Dagger concepts in the [Dagger user manual](../manuals/user/index.mdx).
- As you build more complex Dagger Functions, you will want to know about services, secrets, error handling, custom types, and more. Find in-depth examples and explanations in the [Dagger developer manual](../manuals/developer/index.mdx).
- Looking for detailed reference documentation to assist in your Dagger Function development? Read about the [Dagger API](https://docs.dagger.io/api/reference) and the [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/dagger.io/dagger), [Python](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.org/) and [TypeScript](../reference/typescript/modules.md) SDKs.
- The Daggerverse lets you search for and reuse useful Dagger Functions developed by others in the Dagger community. [Explore the Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev).
