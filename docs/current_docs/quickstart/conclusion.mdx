# Quickstart

## Conclusion

This quickstart has walked you through the process of Daggerizing an example application. It has taught you key Dagger concepts and introduced you to the Dagger API, the Dagger CLI, Dagger Functions, Dagger Cloud, and the Daggerverse.

Lastly, you should now have a [Dagger Cloud](https://dagger.cloud/) account, which helps you visualize your pipelines. This will help you quickly troubleshoot and understand what's happening within any Daggerized pipeline. 

Now you have the tools to successfully take the next step: [adopting Dagger in your own project](https://docs.dagger.io/adopting/).

Additionally, we encourage you to join our awesome community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dagger-io), introduce yourself, share your objectives and ask questions of your fellow Daggernauts.
