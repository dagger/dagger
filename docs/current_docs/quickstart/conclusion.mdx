# Quickstart

## Conclusion

This quickstart has walked you through the process of Daggerizing an example application. It has taught you key Dagger concepts and introduced you to the Dagger API, the Dagger CLI, Dagger Functions and the Daggerverse.

Lastly, you should now also have a [Dagger Cloud](https://dagger.cloud/) account, which helps you visualize your pipelines and gives a unique view of all pipelines, both pre-push and post-push. This will help as you continue on your Dagger journey.

Now you have the tools to successfully take the next step: [adopting Dagger in your project](../adopting).

In the meantime, we encourage you to [join our awesome community on Discord](https://discord.gg/dagger-io) to introduce yourself and ask questions. And [starring our github repository](https://github.com/dagger/dagger) is always appreciated!
