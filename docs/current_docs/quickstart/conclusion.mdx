# Quickstart

## Conclusion

Over the last few pages, this quickstart has walked you through the process of creating a CI pipeline to test, build, package and release an example application using Dagger. It has taught you key Dagger concepts and introduced you to Dagger API, the Dagger CLI, Dagger Functions and the Daggerverse.

Continue learning about Dagger by visiting the resources below:

- The Dagger CLI is the easiest way to work with Dagger Functions. To learn more about the Dagger CLI and see supported commands, visit the [Dagger CLI reference](../reference/979596-cli.mdx).
- Function chaining and just-in-time artifacts are important concepts introduced in this quickstart. Learn more about these and other key Dagger concepts in the [Dagger user manual](../manuals/user/index.mdx).
- This quickstart only gave you the essential information you needed to begin developing your own Dagger Functions. As your Dagger Functions become more complex, you will naturally want to learn more about working with services and secrets, handling errors, using custom types, and more. These and other topics are covered in the [Dagger developer manual](../manuals/developer/index.mdx).
- To assist you in your development of Dagger Functions, detailed reference documentation is available for the [Dagger API](https://docs.dagger.io/api/reference) and for the [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/dagger.io/dagger), [Python](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.org/) and [TypeScript](../reference/typescript/modules.md) SDKs.
- The Daggerverse lets you search for and reuse useful Dagger Functions developed by others in the Dagger community. [Explore the Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev).
