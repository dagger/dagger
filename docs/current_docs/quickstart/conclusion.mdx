# Quickstart

## Conclusion

Over the last few sections, this quickstart has walked you through the process of Daggerizing an example application. It has taught you key Dagger concepts and introduced you to the Dagger API, the Dagger CLI, Dagger Functions and the Daggerverse.

:::tip DAGGERIZING
A common question from our Discord is "how much of my pipeline should I Daggerize?". Our advice is to Daggerize as much as you can get away with, within the constraints of your project. In the extreme version of this, you can collapse your entire application delivery pipeline into a single Dagger Function, which receives a raw source code change event and takes over from there; essentially, your entire CI workflow expressed in code. But typically, you would begin by only Daggerizing simple individual tasks - one Dagger Function per task - and manually configure your CI to call each Dagger Function. This allows for very incremental adoption of Dagger in an existing stack that is hard to change.

Once you've Daggerized your application's pipeline, where do you go next? Here are some ideas:

- Transfer and run your pipeline from your CI provider/tool. You can integrate Dagger with [GitHub Actions](../integrations/github-actions.mdx), [GitLab CI](../integrations/gitlab.mdx), [CircleCI](../integrations/circleci.mdx), [Jenkins](../integrations/jenkins.mdx), [Azure Pipelines](../integrations/azure-pipelines.mdx), [AWS CodeBuild](../integrations/aws-codebuild.mdx), [Argo Workflows](../integrations/argo-workflows.mdx) and [Tekton](../integrations/tekton.mdx).
- Make your Dagger Functions smarter and more powerful, by adding services, secrets, error handling, custom types, and more. Find in-depth documentation in the [Dagger developer manual](../manuals/developer/index.mdx) and in the [Dagger API reference](https://docs.dagger.io/api/reference) and the [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/dagger.io/dagger), [Python](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.org/) and [TypeScript](../reference/typescript/modules.md) SDK documentation.
- Learn more about key Dagger concepts like [function chaining](../manuals/user/functions/chaining.mdx), [just-in-time artifacts](../manuals/user/artifacts/artifacts.mdx), [host access](../manuals/user/host/host.mdx) and [pipeline visualization](../manuals/user/visualization/visualization.mdx) in the [Dagger user manual](../manuals/user/index.mdx).
- [Explore the Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev) to find and reuse useful Dagger Functions developed by the Dagger community. For example, you can [scan a container image for vulnerabilities](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy), [stitch videos together](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/marcosnils/daggerverse/videostitch), [build a Go project](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang), [generate GIFs of interactive terminal sessions](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/shykes/daggerverse/termcast), [integrate with Terraform](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/Excoriate/daggerverse/terraform), [play a game of yamlinvaders](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders), and more!
- [Join the Dagger Discord](https://discord.gg/dagger-io) to ask questions and get help on Daggerizing your own project.
