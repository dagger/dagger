# Quickstart

## Develop ustom functions using existing modules

So far, you've been calling individual Dagger Functions using the Dagger CLI. But you can also call them from a custom Dagger Function that you develop yourself.

Why would you do this?

- As you can see from the previous examples, as you chain more and more Dagger Functions together, using the CLI quickly becomes unwieldy. You might end up needing shell scripting "glue" to assemble your CI pipeline, which comes with its own problems.
- Existing modules from the Daggerverse might not be a 100% fit for the requirements of your CI pipeline. You might need additional tweaks or features to get your pipeline working correctly for you!

Creating your own Dagger Module enables you to chain functions together and completely customize your CI pipeline using code. This lets you transform your workflows into structured, discrete and composable units with clear inputs and outputs, letting you reuse code from existing modules but also giving you all the benefits of using a native programming language.

FIXME: Show two examples here to illustrate above
- customized build() function that calculates a checksum, writes it to a file, adds it to the final container, and also adds OCI image labels to the container before publishing
- single ci() function that runs test/build/publish together ie. dagger call ci

```shell
dagger develop --sdk=go
```
