# Quickstart

## Develop custom functions from scratch

So far, everything you've done in this quickstart has used the Golang Daggerverse module. This module includes all the utilities (test, build, build container) that you need to work with a Go application, allowing you to very quickly assemble a CI pipeline for the application without needing to write much code.

But what happens when you can't find a Daggerverse module that you can leverage to speed up your development?

In this case, you'll have to create your Dagger module and Dagger Functions entirely from scratch, without benefiting from module code written by others in the community. To do this, you'll leverage the Dagger SDKs. Let's examine how to do this next.

FIXME: Replicate the previous section example using core SDK methods, explain each one in detail.
