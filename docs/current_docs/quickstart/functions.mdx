# Quickstart

## Explore available Dagger Functions

Once you've installed the Node module, start exploring it to see what you can do with it. There are various ways to do this:

- Read the [module's auto-generated documentation](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/dagger/dagger/sdk/typescript/dev/node@9e59bae142f64975b7c9ad851e6bd4901d43513a) in the Daggerverse
- Inspect the [module's source code](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/blob/9e59bae142f64975b7c9ad851e6bd4901d43513a/sdk/typescript/dev/node/src/index.ts)
- Use the Dagger CLI to inspect the module

Let's use the `dagger functions` command to inspect the Dagger Functions available in the Node module:

```shell
dagger -m node functions
```

You should see the following output:

```
Name          Description
commands      Execute commands in the container.
container     -
install       Downloads dependencies in the container.
version       -
with-npm      Add npm as package manager in the container.
with-pnpm     Add pnpm as package manager in the container.
with-source   Add source to the module container.
with-yarn     Add yarn as package manager in the container.
```

From the output, you can see that this module includes Dagger Functions to install dependencies (`install`) and execute commands (`execute`) for a Node.js application.

Dagger Functions, just like regular functions, can accept arguments. You can use the Dagger CLI to dynamically inspect a Dagger Function and display a context-sensitive list of its supported arguments and sub-commands, simply by appending `--help` to a CLI command.

Let's list the available arguments for the `commands` Dagger Function in the Node module:

```shell
dagger -m node call commands --help
```

You should see the following output:

```
Execute commands in the container.

Usage:
  dagger call commands [flags]
  dagger call commands [flags] [command]

Function Commands:
  build
  lint
  run
  test

Global Flags:
  -d, --debug             show debug logs and full verbosity
      --json              Present result as JSON
  -m, --mod string        Path to dagger.json config file for the module or a directory containing that
                          file. Either local path (e.g. "/path/to/some/dir") or a github repo (e.g.
                          "github.com/dagger/dagger/path/to/some/subdir")
  -o, --output string     Path in the host to save the result to
      --progress string   progress output format (auto, plain, tty) (default "auto")
  -s, --silent            disable terminal UI and progress output
  -v, --verbose count     increase verbosity (use -vv or -vvv for more)

Use "dagger call commands [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Notice the `run` and `build` commands. You'll use them in the next sections!

:::tip FUNCTION ARGUMENTS
Dagger Functions, just like regular functions, can accept arguments. In addition to basic types (string, boolean, integer, array...), Dagger also defines powerful core types which functions can use for their arguments, such as `Directory`, `File`, `Container`, `Service`, and `Secret`. Arguments to a Dagger Function may be optional or mandatory.
