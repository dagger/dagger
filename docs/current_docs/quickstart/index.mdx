# Quickstart

Welcome to Dagger, a programmable tool that lets you replace your software project's artisanal scripts with a modern API and cross-language scripting engine.

Dagger can help you create a consistent, reliable development and testing environment on your local host and ensure that everything your CI can do, your local environment can do too.

## Topics

This quickstart introduces you to:

- The Dagger API, which lets you use core primitives to stitch together powerful pipelines out of containers, artifacts, network services, and secrets â€“ all in type-safe Go, Python or TypeScript.
- Dagger Functions, which let you encapsulate code into software components which can be loaded into any Dagger Engine, and called by other Dagger Functions.
- The Dagger CLI, which lets you create, inspect and invoke Dagger Functions from the command line.
- The Daggerverse, which lets you search and consume publicly available Dagger Functions.

## Goal

After going through this quickstart, you will have the tools and skills to create a CI pipeline to test, build and release your code, and start replacing your custom CI scripts with reusable Dagger Functions from the Daggerverse or that you create yourself.

## Approach

This quickstart is structured as a hands-on workshop, in which you will create a CI pipeline for an example application, then run and test it locally. It discusses two approaches:

1. Using the core Dagger API: To begin, you will build a CI pipeline for the example application using only the Dagger API. This is an important first step to learn how Dagger works and to understand key concepts and techniques. It is critical knowledge for when no Daggerverse module exists for your requirements and you need to start from scratch.

1. Using a Daggerverse module: At a later stage, you will refactor the same CI pipeline using a module from the Daggerverse. This alternative approach introduces you to the Daggerverse, a key component of the Dagger ecosystem. It demonstrates the speed and efficiency benefits of reusing existing Dagger modules when constructing your CI pipeline.

## Requirements

This quickstart will take you approximately 40 minutes to complete. You should be familiar with programming in Go, Python or TypeScript, and you should have a basic understanding of [what Dagger is and how it works](../index.mdx).

:::danger 40 MINUTES?! I CAN'T SPEND THAT MUCH TIME!
If you're short of time, try our [speedrun](./speedrun.mdx), which can be completed in less than 10 minutes. It favors code over verbosity and is designed to give you a quick taste of Dagger's capabilities. When you have more time, come back here for the details.
:::

To complete this quickstart, you will need Git and the Dagger CLI installed on your machine. Dagger also requires a container runtime. This can be [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), but you can also use Podman, nerdctl, or other Docker-like systems.
