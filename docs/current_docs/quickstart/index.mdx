# Quickstart

Welcome to Dagger, a programmable tool that lets you replace your software project's artisanal scripts with a modern API and cross-language scripting engine.

Dagger can help you create a consistent, reliable development and testing environment on your local host and ensure that everything your CI can do, your local environment can do too.

## What you will learn

This quickstart tutorial introduces you to:

- The Dagger API, which lets you use core primitives to stitch together powerful pipelines out of containers, artifacts, network services, and secrets â€“ all in type-safe Go, Python or TypeScript.
- Dagger Functions, which let you encapsulate code into a software component which can be loaded into any Dagger Engine, and called by other Dagger Functions.
- The Dagger CLI, which lets you create, inspect and invoke Dagger Functions from the command-line.
- The Daggerverse, which lets you search and consume publicly available Dagger Functions.

Some of the things you will learn are in this quickstart are:

After going through this quickstart, you will have the tools and skills to create a CI pipeline to test, build and publish your code from the command line, and start replacing your custom CI scripts with reusable Dagger Functions from the Daggerverse or that you create yourself.

## Requirements

To use this tutorial, you only need Git and the Dagger CLI installed on your machine. You should also be familiar with programming in Go, Python or TypeScript.

Note that Dagger requires a container runtime. This can be [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), but you can also use Podman, nerdctl, or other Docker-like systems.
