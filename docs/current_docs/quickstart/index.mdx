# Quickstart

Welcome to Dagger, a programmable tool that lets you replace your software project's artisanal scripts with a modern API and cross-language scripting engine.

This tutorial walks you, step by step, through the basics of using the Dagger CLI, developing your first Dagger Function, and packaging it into a module.

## What you will learn

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Install the Dagger CLI
- Call a Dagger Function
- Understand Dagger Functions
- Use Dagger Functions with directories and containers
- Chain Dagger Functions together into a pipeline
- Write your own Dagger Function

## Requirements

To use this tutorial, you only need the Dagger CLI installed on your machine.

Note that Dagger requires a container runtime. This can be [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), but you can also use Podman, nerdctl, or other Docker-like systems.
