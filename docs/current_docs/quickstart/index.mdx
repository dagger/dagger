# Quickstart

Welcome to Dagger, a programmable tool that lets you replace your software project's artisanal scripts with a modern API and cross-language scripting engine.

Dagger can help you create a consistent, reliable development and testing environment on your local host and ensure that everything your CI can do, your local environment can do too.

After going through this quickstart tutorial, you will have the tools and skills to create a CI pipeline to test, build and publish your code from the command line using the Dagger CLI, and start replacing your custom CI scripts with reusable Dagger Functions from the Daggerverse or that you create yourself.

## Requirements

To use this tutorial, you only need Git and the Dagger CLI installed on your machine. You should also be familiar with programming in Go, Python or TypeScript.

Note that Dagger requires a container runtime. This can be [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), but you can also use Podman, nerdctl, or other Docker-like systems.
