# Quickstart

## Daggerize the application's release process

At this point, you've used Dagger Functions to test, build and deliver the application to your local host. But why not also package the application binary and publish a containerized image to a registry?

The Golang module has a `build-container` Dagger Function which builds and packages the application as a container. The arguments to this Dagger Function are similar to those of the `build` Dagger Function on the previous page.

Use the following command to see it in action:

```shell
dagger -m golang call \
  build-container --source=. --args=.
```

You should see the application being compiled and the resulting binary added to a container image. Once complete, you should see the following output:

```
Container evaluated. Use "dagger call build-container --help" to see available sub-commands.
```

This means that the build succeeded, and a `Container` type representing the built container image was returned. And, like `Directory`, `Container` is a Dagger core type which comes with useful functions of its own.

One of the most interesting `Container` functions is `terminal`, which can be used to open an interactive terminal session with the container. This feature is very useful for debugging and experimenting since it allows you to interact with containers directly and at any stage of your Dagger function execution.

To see this in action, revise the previous command and chain an additional function call to `terminal` on the returned `Container`:

```shell
dagger -m golang call \
  build-container --source=. --args=. \
  terminal
```

This revised command builds the container image and then drops you into an interactive terminal, allowing you to directly execute commands in the running container. For example, you can list the contents of the container filesystem to verify that it includes the newly-compiled binary, or check the file type of the binary:

```shell
ls -al

file greetings-api
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
FIXME
```

:::caution
While most terminal programs such as `htop` or `vim` work with `dagger call ... terminal`, you may experience visual bugs with some programs due to terminal emulator incompatibilities.
:::

The `Container` type also has a `publish` function, which publishes the container to a registry. To see this in action, go back to the original command and chain an additional function call to `publish` on the returned `Container`, as shown below:

```shell
dagger -m golang call \
  build-container --source=. --args=. \
  publish --address ttl.sh/myapp-$RANDOM
```

You should the container image being built and published, with the final result being a container image reference on the [ttl.sh container registry](https://ttl.sh), as shown below:

```
ttl.sh/myapp-47384@sha256:57c15999fdc59df452161f648aaa9b9a1ea9dbda710a0a0242f509966a286b4b
```
