# Quickstart

## Publish the container image

The end stage of the example pipeline is the `publish` stage, which publishes the container image to a registry.

### Inspect the Dagger Function

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

```go file=./snippets/publish/go/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

```python file=./snippets/publish/python/__init__.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript file=./snippets/publish/typescript/index.ts
```

Just as you can call Dagger Functions individually from the CLI, you can also call (and combine) them using a programming language. This Dagger Function is an example. It is a higher-level function which orchestrates the Dagger Functions in previous sections and the core Dagger API to:
- run the application's tests and return the results;
- build and return a container image of the final application;
- publish the container image to a registry and return the image identifier.

:::tip COMBINING DAGGER FUNCTIONS
There are various reasons why you might want to write Dagger Functions that call other Dagger Functions. A common reason is that when developing locally, it's quicker and easier to trigger your pipeline using a single command (`dagger call publish ...`) instead of multiple commands (`dagger call test ... && dagger call build ... &&  ...`).

### Call the Dagger Function

Call the Dagger Function:

```shell
dagger call publish --source=.
```

You should see the application being tested, built, and published to the [ttl.sh container registry](https://ttl.sh):

You can test the published container image by pulling and running it with `docker run`:

:::tip FUNCTION CHAINING
[Function chaining](../features/programmable-pipelines.mdx) works the same way, whether you're writing Dagger Function code using a Dagger SDK or invoking a Dagger Function using the Dagger CLI. The following are equivalent:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

```go file=./snippets/chain/go/main.go
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python">

```python file=./snippets/chain/python/__init__.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">

```typescript file=./snippets/chain/typescript/index.ts
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dagger CLI">
```shell
# all equivalent
dagger call base with-exec --args apk,add,bash,git publish --address="ttl.sh/bar"
dagger call build publish --address="ttl.sh/bar"
dagger call build-and-publish
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
