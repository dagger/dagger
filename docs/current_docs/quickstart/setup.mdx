# Quickstart

## Set up the example application

The best way to understand how Dagger works is by creating a composable CI pipeline in code for an application - a process we call "Daggerizing".

Daggerizing the CI pipeline for an existing application involves the following steps:

1. Choose a Dagger SDK and bootstrap a new Dagger module for your pipeline with `dagger init`.
2. Search for useful third-party Dagger modules from the Daggerverse and install them as dependencies with `dagger install`.
3. Compose your pipeline by creating and combining one or more Dagger Functions to produce the desired results. Your Dagger Functions can use the core Dagger API and/or call Dagger Functions from third-party Daggerverse modules.
4. Use `dagger call` to run and test your pipeline locally. Once you're satisfied, transfer your Dagger module and your `dagger call` commands to your CI configuration.

This quickstart walks you through these steps by Daggerizing an example application. It will discusses two approaches:

1. Using the core Dagger API: To begin, you will build a CI pipeline for the example application using only the Dagger API. This is an important first step to learn how Dagger works and to understand key concepts and techniques. It is also critical knowledge for when no Daggerverse module exists for your requirements and you need to start from scratch.
1. Using a Daggerverse module: At a later stage, you will refactor the same CI pipeline using a module from the Daggerverse. This alternative approach introduces you to the Daggerverse, a key component of the Dagger ecosystem. It also demonstrates the speed and efficiency benefits of reusing existing Dagger modules when constructing your CI pipeline.

The example application is a skeleton Vue framework application written in TypeScript and modified with a "Hello from Dagger!" welcome page. Inspect its [source code repository](https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger), then clone it into your local development environment and set it as the current working directory:

```shell
# FIXME: this will eventually be the hello-dagger repository
git clone https://github.com/kpenfound/greetings-api.git hello-dagger
cd hello-dagger
# FIXME: should be removed in the final example app
rm dagger.json
```

:::tip DAGGERIZING
A common question from our Discord is "how much of my pipeline should I Daggerize?". Our advice is to Daggerize as much as you can get away with, within the constraints of your project. In the extreme version of this, you can collapse your entire CI pipeline into a single Dagger Function, which receives a raw source code change event and takes over from there; essentially, your entire CI workflow expressed in code. But typically, you would begin by only Daggerizing simple individual tasks - one Dagger Function per task - and manually configure your CI to call each Dagger Function. This allows for very incremental adoption of Dagger in an existing stack that is hard to change.
