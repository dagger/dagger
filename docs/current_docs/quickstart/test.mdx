# Quickstart

## Daggerize the application tests

You're now ready to dive into Dagger and call your first Dagger Function! Use the following command:

```shell
dagger -m golang call test --source=.
```

You should see various operations taking place, ending with a test run and the following output:

```
OK
```

Well done! You just called your first Dagger Function!

Let's break down the command you just ran to understand what just happened:

- `dagger -m golang call test`: This tells Dagger to load the Golang module, and execute the Dagger Function named `test` from that module.
- `--source=.`: Dagger Functions, just like regular functions, can accept arguments. These might be simple string, numeric or Boolean arguments, or more complex Dagger-specific types like `Directory`, `File`, or `Container`. In this case, the `source` argument is passed to the Dagger Function with the current working directory as value; this tells the Dagger Function where to find the application's source code.

Inspect the [module's source code](https://github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/blob/44564d6443a919a2c3f1dd7ad02fc22b5fb9db8c/golang/main.go#L107) to understand what happens when it's invoked via `dagger call`:

- The module uses the Dagger Go SDK and is written using standard Go conventions.
- It contains a number of functions, one of which is named `Test()`.
- The `Test()` function expects a `source` argument of type `Directory`, which is a special Dagger type. The `Directory` type can refer to either a local directory or a remote Git repository.

:::tip
When using `dagger call`, all names (functions, arguments, fields, etc) are converted into a shell-friendly "kebab-case" style. This is why the function named `Test()` is invoked as `dagger call test`.
:::

Dig a little deeper to see what the `Test()` function does:

- It uses the `Container().From()` method to initialize a new container from a base image. In this example, the base image is `golang:1.21`. This method returns a `Container` type representing an OCI-compatible container image.
- It uses the `Container.WithDirectory()` method to mount the source code directory passed to the Dagger Function via the `source` argument in the container, and the `Container.WithWorkdir()` method to set the working directory to that mount point.
- It uses the `Container.WithExec()` method to define the command to be executed in the container - in this case, the command `go test`, which runs the application's test suite. The `WithExec()` method returns a revised `Container` with the results of command execution.
- It retrieves the output stream of the last executed with the `Container.Stdout()` method and prints the result to the console.



Dagger Functions, just like regular functions, can accept arguments.
