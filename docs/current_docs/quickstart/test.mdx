# Quickstart

## Inspect the test stage

The pipeline also runs the application's unit tests, to make sure everything works before building the final container image.

Remember that the `Publish()` Dagger Function also depends on the `Test()` Dagger Function. Let's look at that next!

```go file=./snippets/test/go/main.go
```

The `Test()` Dagger Function works merely as a CLI wrapper around the `npm run test:unit run` command.
- It first calls `BuildEnv()` to obtain the build environment container.
- It then uses the `Container().WithExec()` method to set this command to run in the container, and the `Container().Stdout()` method to capture and return the output as a string.

Call it with the Dagger CLI:

```shell
dagger call \
  test --source=.
```

You should see various operations taking place, ending with a test run and the following output:

```
> hello-dagger@0.0.0 test:unit
> vitest run

 RUN  v1.5.3 /src

:::tip SANDBOXING
All the Dagger Functions in this quickstart receive the location of the source code directory as a function argument, rather than reading it directly from the host filesystem. This is [by design](../manuals/developer/execution-environment.mdx): Dagger Functions are fully "sandboxed" and do not have direct access to the host system. Therefore, host resources such as directories, files, environment variables, network services and so on must be explicitly passed to Dagger Functions as arguments. This "sandboxing" of Dagger Functions improves security, ensures reproducibility, and assists caching.
