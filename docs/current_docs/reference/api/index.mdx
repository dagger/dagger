# Dagger API

The Dagger API is an unified interface for composing Dagger workflows. It provides a set of core functions and core types for creating and managing application delivery workflows, including types for containers, files, directories, network services, secrets, and more. You can call these functions from `dagger`, the Dagger CLI, or from custom functions written in any supported programming language.
