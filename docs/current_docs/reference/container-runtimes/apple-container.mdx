Dagger can be used with any OCI-compatible container runtime, including [`container` from Apple](https://github.com/apple/container).

:::warning
The support for Apple's `container` is still early and experimental.
:::

## How it works

By default, Dagger tries to invoke the `docker` executable at some points during the invocation of `dagger`. Since `container` is partially CLI-compatible with Docker, some functionality works out of the box, and there is a way to get running by combining a symbolic link named `docker` pointing to the `container` executable, together with the approach of [Custom Runner support](https://docs.dagger.io/configuration/custom-runner).

## Prerequisites

- `container` installed and API server running on the host system, through `container system start`.

## Example

To use `container` with Dagger:

- create a symbolic link in a superior `PATH` position as below:

    ```shell
    sudo ln -s $(which container) /usr/local/bin/docker
    ```
- start the Dagger Engine using appropriate values for memory and cpus:
    ```shell
    container run --rm -d \
      --memory 16G \
      --cpus 4 \
      --name dagger-engine-custom \
      registry.dagger.io/engine:v0.18.12
    ```
- set this env var wherever you want to reach your Dagger Engine:
    ```shell
    export _EXPERIMENTAL_DAGGER_RUNNER_HOST=docker-container://dagger-engine-custom
    ```

:::info
there is no `container ps`, so use `container ls`

## About `container`

[`container`](https://github.com/apple/container) is a tool for creating and running Linux containers using lightweight virtual machines on a Mac. It is written in Swift, and optimized for Apple silicon.
