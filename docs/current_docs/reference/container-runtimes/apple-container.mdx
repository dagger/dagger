# Apple Container

Dagger can be used with any OCI-compatible container runtime, including [`container` from Apple](https://github.com/apple/container).

:::warning
The support for Apple's `container` is still early and experimental.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that `container` is installed on your Mac:

```console
$ container system start
...
```

You can install `container` using the official instruction at [github.com/apple/container](https://github.com/apple/container).

## Example

```console
$ container ls
ID  IMAGE  OS  ARCH  STATE  ADDR  CPUS  MEMORY
$ dagger core version
v0.18.19
$ container ls
container ls
ID                      IMAGE                               OS     ARCH   STATE    ADDR          CPUS  MEMORY
