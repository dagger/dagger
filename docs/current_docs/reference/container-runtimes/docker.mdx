# Docker

Dagger can be used with any OCI-compatible container runtime, including Docker.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that docker is running on the host system:

```console
$ docker info
Client:
 Version:    28.4.0
 Context:    default
 ...
```

You can install docker:

- Using the instructions from the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- From your system package manager:
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install docker.io`
  - Fedora: `dnf install docker`
  - Arch Linux: `pacman -S docker`
- Using a third-party tool like [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/).

## Example

```console
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                         NAMES
$ dagger core version
v0.18.19
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                         NAMES

```
