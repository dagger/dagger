# Nerdctl

Dagger can be used with any OCI-compatible container runtime, including
`nerdctl` and `finch` (which uses `nerdctl` under the hood).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that `nerdctl` (or `finch`) is installed and running on your system:

```console
$ nerdctl info
Client:
 Namespace: default
 Debug Mode: false
```

:::warning
To be able to use the `nerdctl` backend as unprivileged user, `nerdctl` must be
installed and running on the host system in [rootless mode](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl/blob/main/docs/rootless.md).
:::

### Using `lima`

To use `nerdctl` with Dagger via `lima`, create the following shell script at `/usr/local/bin/nerdctl`:

```console
#!/bin/sh
lima nerdctl "$@"
```

## Example

```console
$ nerdctl ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                         NAMES
$ nerdctl core version
v0.18.19
$ nerdctl ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                         NAMES

```
