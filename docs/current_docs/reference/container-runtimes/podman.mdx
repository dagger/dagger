# Podman

Dagger can be used with any OCI-compatible container runtime, including Podman.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that podman is installed and running on your system:

```console
$ podman info
host:
  arch: amd64
  buildahVersion: 1.41.4
  ...
```

:::warning
Podman must be configured for [rootful container execution](https://docs.podman.io/en/stable/markdown/podman-machine-set.1.html#rootful).
:::

You can install podman using the [official instructions](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation).

:::note
Podman Desktop on Mac and RHEL 8.x users may need to additionally execute `modprobe iptable_nat`.

To access the virtual machine used by Podman Desktop on Mac, use the commands below:

```console
# list podman machines
podman machine list

# log in to machine
podman machine ssh podman-machine-default

# execute command
sudo modprobe iptable_nat
```
:::

## Example

```console
$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS       PORTS                                         NAMES

$ podman ps
