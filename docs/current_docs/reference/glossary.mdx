In order to help you navigate the Dagger documentation, we have compiled a glossary of terms that are frequently used. This glossary will help you understand the key concepts and terminology used throughout the documentation.

### Dagger Engine
The Dagger Engine is the core component of the Dagger platform that executes workflows. It manages the execution of Dagger Functions and ensures that they are run in the correct order, with the appropriate inputs and outputs.

### Dagger Function
A Dagger Function is a reusable block of code that can be executed within a Dagger workflow. Functions can take inputs, perform actions, and return outputs, making them a powerful tool for building complex workflows.

### Dagger Module
A Dagger Module is a collection of Dagger Functions that can be used together to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Modules can be imported and used in different workflows, allowing for code reuse and modularity.

### Typed Object
A Typed Object is a specific type of data structure in Dagger that represents a particular kind of data, such as a `Container`, `Directory`, or `LLM`. Typed Objects have associated functions that allow you to manipulate and interact with the data they represent.
