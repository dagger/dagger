In order to help you navigate the Dagger documentation, we have compiled a glossary of terms that are frequently used. This glossary will help you understand the key concepts and terminology used throughout the documentation.

### Dagger Function
A Dagger Function is a reusable block of code that can be executed within a Dagger workflow. Functions can take inputs, perform actions, and return outputs, making them a powerful tool for building complex workflows.

### Dagger Module
A Dagger Module is a collection of Dagger Functions that can be used together to perform a specific task or set of tasks. Modules can be imported and used in different workflows, allowing for code reuse and modularity.

### Typed Object
A Typed Object is a specific type of data structure in Dagger that represents a particular kind of data, such as a `Container`, `Directory`, or `LLM`. Typed Objects have associated functions that allow you to manipulate and interact with the data they represent.
