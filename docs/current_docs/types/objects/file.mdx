<FileType />

:::tip
[Default paths](./directory.mdx#default-paths) are also available for `File` arguments. They
are commonly used to load constant filesystem locations, such as an
application's source code directory. Additionally, when a value is explicitly
passed for the argument, it always overrides the default path.

## Examples
