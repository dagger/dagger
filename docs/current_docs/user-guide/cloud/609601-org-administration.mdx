# Organization Administration

## Members

A member account grants a person access to log in to a Dagger Cloud organization to diagnose pipeline failures and collaborate on changes. Member information shown on the *All Runs* and *All Changes* pages is populated by the VCS you have integrated with Dagger Cloud. Deleting a member of a Dagger Cloud organization will not remove their runs and changes from Dagger Cloud.

:::note
You must hold the *Admin* role of a Dagger Cloud organization to administer members. You cannot change a member's role. Please contact Dagger Support via the in-app messenger for assistance if you need to change a member's role. This functionality is coming soon.

You can:

* Add a member to the organization
* Delete a member from the organization
