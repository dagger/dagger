# How It works

Understanding how Dagger works is key for understanding the tool. If you understand Dagger, you can develop complex pipelines and experiment in ways that are not even documented yet with your preferred CI/CD tools.

## 💎 Core Concepts

In this section you can easily find the main concepts inside Dagger and navigate trough them.

## 🚀 Time to use Dagger

If you haven't installed Dagger yet, we recommend you do it in order to consolidate the main concepts. After seeing the tool in action by yourself, you'll understand the concepts easily.

export const CardGrid = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.cardGrid}>
      {data.map((x, index) => (
        <Link
          href={x.url}
          style={{ textDecoration: "none" }}
          className={styles.link}
          key={index}
        >
          <div
            className={`${styles.card} ${x.fullWidth ? styles.fullWidth : ""}`}
          >
            <img className="not-zoom" src={`/img/${x.imgFilename}`} />
            <div className={styles.description}>
