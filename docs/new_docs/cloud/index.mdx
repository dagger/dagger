A Trace represents one invocation of a Dagger Function, run locally or in CI. It contains detailed information about the operations performed by the Dagger Function.

Traces provides a UI to debug what went wrong when something fails, focusing on tracing what happened and when it happened.

Traces also helps you optimize your Dagger Functions as you author them, by giving you the detailed step-by-step execution of your workflow and the associated telemetry

This is equally useful for debugging workflows running on a developer's local environment and for workflows in CI environments.

## OpenTelemetry

Dagger uses OpenTelemetry (OTel) as its telemetry protocol -- both the TUI and Dagger Cloud are powered by OTel. Each Dagger Function call is represented as an OpenTelemetry trace. The operations performed by the Dagger Function are represented as OpenTelemetry spans. A span can emit several effects, which are the operations generated in the span. For example, the `withDirectory()` span generates all the necessary operations to provide a directory with excluded and included elements. For this, it first loads a directory, and then creates a new one from scratch inside the container, generating two distinct steps (effects).

Dagger is aware of the context it runs in. The Dagger Cloud dashboard classifies Traces depending on whether you triggered a run from your local development host or from your CI environment. You can select the appropriate view from the dashboard. 

Here's an example showing Traces generated in both CI and local environments:


## Organization & Auth

Dagger Cloud provides robust organization and authentication features to manage access and permissions across your pipelines. With fine-grained access controls, you can ensure that only authorized users can modify or view specific pipelines, enhancing security and compliance.

## Operational insights

Dagger Cloud gives a unique view across all pipelines, both pre-push and post-push. Platform teams gain holistic visibility into the pipelines being used across the organization, enabling them to standardize and streamline processes, catch errors, and reduce duplication of effort. See which Functions were called by each pipeline and see docs for them in the Daggerverse.
