description: "Dagger Cloud provides Traces, a browser-based interface focused on tracing and debugging Dagger Functions"
---

A Trace represents one invocation of a Dagger Function, run locally or in CI. It contains detailed information about the operations performed by the Dagger Function.

Traces provides a UI to debug what went wrong when something fails, focusing on tracing what happened and when it happened.

Traces also helps you optimize your Dagger Functions as you author them, by giving you the detailed step-by-step execution of your workflow and the associated telemetry

This is equally useful for debugging workflows running on a developer's local environment and for workflows in CI environments.
