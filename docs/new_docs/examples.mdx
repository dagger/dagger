## Cookbook examples

The [Dagger Cookbook](/cookbook) contains practical code examples for common tasks:

- [Filesystem operations](/cookbook#filesystem): Working with files and directories
- [Build operations](/cookbook#builds): Building applications and container images
- [Service management](/cookbook#services): Working with services and networking
- [Secret management](/cookbook#secrets): Managing sensitive data securely
