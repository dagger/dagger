## Prerequisites

To use Dagger, you must have a container runtime installed and running. This can be [Docker](https://docker.com), [Podman](https://podman.io), [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl), or other Docker-like systems.

## Stable release

Install the latest stable release of the Dagger CLI following the steps below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
   We assume that you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed. If you do, you can install `dagger` with a single command:

    ```shell wrap
    brew install dagger/tap/dagger
    ```

    <Note>
    Note: This installs `dagger` in:

    ```shell wrap
    type dagger
    # Expected output on macOS ARM:
    # dagger is /opt/homebrew/bin/dagger
    # Expected output on macOS Intel:
    # dagger is /usr/local/bin/dagger
    ```
    </Note>

    If you do not have Homebrew installed, you can use [install.sh](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/blob/main/install.sh):

    ```shell wrap
    curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
    ```

    If your user account doesn't have sufficient privileges to install in
    `/usr/local` and `sudo` is available, you can set `BIN_DIR` and use `sudo -E`:

    ```shell wrap
    curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
    ```

    If you want to set a specific version, you can set `DAGGER_VERSION`:

    ```shell wrap 
    curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | DAGGER_VERSION=${daggerVersion} BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
    ```

    To see the installed version of dagger:

    ```shell wrap
    ./bin/dagger version
    # Expected output: 
    # dagger v${daggerVersion} (registry.dagger.io/engine:v${daggerVersion}) darwin/amd64
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    The quickest way of installing the latest stable release of `dagger` on Linux is to use [install.sh](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/blob/main/install.sh):

    ```shell wrap
    curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin sh
    ```

    <Note>
    This installs `dagger` in `$HOME/.local/bin`:

    ```shell wrap
    type dagger
    # Expected output: dagger is $HOME/.local/bin/dagger
    ```

    You may need to add it to your `$PATH` environment variable.
    </Note>

    If you want to install globally, and `sudo` is available, you can specify an
    alternative install location by setting `BIN_DIR` and using `sudo -E`:

    ```shell wrap
    curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
    ```

    If you want to set a specific version, you can set `DAGGER_VERSION`:

    ```shell wrap
    curl -fsSL https://dl.dagger.io/dagger/install.sh | DAGGER_VERSION=${daggerVersion} BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin sh
    ```

    To see the installed version of dagger:

    ```shell wrap
    ./bin/dagger version
    # Expected output: dagger v${daggerVersion} (registry.dagger.io/engine:v${daggerVersion}) linux/amd64
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    The simplest way to install Dagger on Windows is using the Windows Package Manager:

    ```powershell
    winget install Dagger.Cli
    ```

    To verify the installation:

    ```powershell
    dagger version
    ```
  </Tab>
