  <Step title="Zed Agents in Containers">
    Zed already delivers an incredible agent experience—custom profiles, a built-in rules library, and flexible model support. But with container use, it unlocks a new mode entirely.

    In this demo, you’ll see how container use gives coding agents full write access inside isolated, disposable containers. No more scrambling your files. No more worrying about cleanup. Just safe, background environments that let you experiment freely.
