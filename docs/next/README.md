## docs/next

The `docs/next` directory holds documentation for a future version of cloak.
It is meant as a continuously evolving design spec to guide development.

When possible, design proposals should add or modify documents in `docs/next`.

The contents of `docs/next` are authoritative, but not final:

* *Authoritative*: implementers should either follow `docs/next` as a spec, or
  propose changes to the parts of `docs/next` they disagree with.

* *Not final*: `docs/next` can be changed at any time, as we learn more and incorporate
  new ideas.
