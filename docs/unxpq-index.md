# Introduction

Dagger is a DevOps automation engine. It makes it easy to develop powerful DevOps pipelines in any programming language, and embed them into your existing scripts, tools and platforms.

Popular use cases include multi-stage builds, CI/CD, on-demand staging environments, machine learning pipelines, end-to-end testing, artifact scanning and signing, and more.

## Features

Key features include:

* Write pipelines in your favorite programming language
* Portability across CI and development platforms
* Run pipelines from your existing tools, instead of learning yet another CLI
* Faster builds with automatic caching
* Highly portable pipelines run entirely in containers
* Easy to test and troubleshoot pipelines locally

Using Dagger does not require converting to yet another DevOps platform. Instead, Dagger empowers you to retrofit the capabilities of a modern DevOps platform into the tooling and workflows you already have.
