# What is Dagger?

<CautionBanner old="0.1" new="0.2" />

Dagger is a portable devkit for CICD. It helps you develop powerful CICD pipelines that can run anywhere.

- Choose from a wide catalog of reusable actions, or create your own in your favorite programming language.
- Tie it all together with [CUE](https://cuelang.org), the next-generation declarative language invented at Google. No more YAML hell!
- Unify dev and CI. The same Dagger pipeline can run on your dev machine or in CI. All you need is a Docker-compatible runtime.
- Avoid CI lock-in. Dagger runs natively on GitHub Actions, GitLab, CircleCI, Jenkins, AWS Codebuild, Tekton, and more.
- Test and debug your pipelines locally; catch configuration errors in seconds with static type checking.

## Dagger is alpha software

Warning! Dagger is _alpha-quality software_. It has many bugs, the user interface is minimal, and it may change in incompatible ways at any time. If you are still
willing to try it, thank you! We appreciate your help and encourage you to [ask
questions](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/discussions) and [report issues](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues).
