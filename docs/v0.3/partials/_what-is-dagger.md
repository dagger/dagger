Dagger is a CI/CD engine that is **programmable** and **container-native**.

* **Programmable**: develop your CI/CD pipelines as code, in the same programming language as your application.
* **Container-native**: Dagger executes your pipelines entirely as [standard OCI containers](https://opencontainers.org), so the same pipeline can run on your local machine, a CI runner, a dedicated server, or any container hosting service. Other benefits of container-native pipelines include superior caching; cross-language instrumentation; compatibility with the massive Docker ecosystem; and more.
