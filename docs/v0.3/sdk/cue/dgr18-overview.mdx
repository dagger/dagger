# Dagger CUE SDK

### What is the Dagger CUE SDK?

The Dagger CUE SDK contains everything you need to develop CI/CD pipelines in CUE, and run them on any OCI-compatible container runtime.

Currently the CUE SDK consists of:

- A CLI, `dagger-cue`
- The Dagger Engine (launched by the CLI by default)
- CUE SDK packages and sample applications
- This documentation

### Who is it for?

People who want to write their CI/CD pipelines in CUE while taking advantage of the Dagger CUE SDK's types and actions and the Dagger Engine's caching and parallelization. 

### How it works

You write pipelines using the Dagger CUE SDK and execute on a Dagger Engine by using the `dagger-cue` CLI. You can connect to an existing Dagger Engine, or the `dagger-cue` CLI will provision one on-the-fly.

### Getting started
To learn more, [install the CUE SDK]() and [start using it]().
