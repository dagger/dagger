# Known Issues

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

This page describes known issues you may encounter when developing Dagger Modules.

- When referencing another module as a local dependency, the dependent module
  must be stored in a sub-directory of the parent module.
- Calls to functions across modules will be run exactly _once_ per-session --
  after that, the result will be cached, but only until the next session (a new
  `dagger call`, etc).

## Go

- A module's public fields require a `json:"foo"` tag to be queriable.
- Custom struct types cannot currently be used as parameters.
