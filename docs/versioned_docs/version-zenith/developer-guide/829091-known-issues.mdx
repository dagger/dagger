# Known Issues

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

This page describes known issues you may encounter when developing Dagger Modules.

- Calls to functions across modules will be run exactly _once_ per-session --
  after that, the result will be cached, but only until the next session (a new
  `dagger call`, etc).
