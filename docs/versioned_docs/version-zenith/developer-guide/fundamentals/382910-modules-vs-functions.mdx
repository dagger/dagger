# Dagger Modules vs Dagger Functions

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

Dagger Functions are regular code, written in a supported programming language, and run in containers. Dagger Functions let you encapsulate common operations or workflows into discrete units with clear inputs and outputs.

Dagger Functions are packaged, shared and reused using Dagger Modules. Dagger Modules can contain one or more Dagger Functions. Dagger lets you add dependencies to your Dagger Modules, so that you can import, reuse and build on Dagger Modules created by others.
