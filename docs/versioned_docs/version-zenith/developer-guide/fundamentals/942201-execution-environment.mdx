# Execution Environment

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

## Containerization

All Modules and their Functions execute within containers spawned by the Dagger Engine. This serves a few purposes:
1. Reproducibility - executing in a well-defined and well-controlled container makes it easier for your code to run the same way every time it is invoked. This makes it easier to reason about; you can't accidentally create "hidden dependencies" on ambient properties of the execution environment that could change at any moment.
1. Caching - the reproducible containerized environment makes it possible to cache the result of Function execution, which in turn allows Dagger to automatically speed up Function execution.
1. Security - Even when running third-party Modules sourced from a Git repository, those Functions will not have default access to your host environment (e.g. files, directories, environment variables, etc.). They can only be granted access by explicitly passing those resources as argument values to the Function.

## Code execution
When implementing Functions, you are free to write arbitrary code that will execute inside the Module's container. You have access to the Dagger API to make calls to the Core Dagger API or other Modules you depend on, but you are also free to just use the language's standard library and/or imported third-party libraries.

The process your code executes in will currently be with the "root" user, but without a full set of Linux capabilities and other standard container sandboxing provided by runC.

The current working directory of your code will be an initially empty directory. You can write and read files and directories in this directory if needed. This includes using the `Export` APIs on `File`/`Directory`/`Container` to write those to this local directory if needed.

## `CurrentModule` API
The Dagger API client made available to all Functions includes a `CurrentModule` API that provides abilities to introspect the Function's Module and interface between the current execution environment and the Dagger API.

For example:
1. The `Source` API on `CurrentModule` returns a `Directory` where your Module's source code is stored, which grants access to any files or directories within there.
1. The `Workdir` and `WorkdirFile` APIs on `CurrentModule` allow you to load directories and files, respectively, from your Functions current working directory (as described in the above section).

# Using Host Resources

As mentioned above, Functions execute in containers and thus do not have access to resources on the host you invoke the Function from (i.e. the host you execute a CLI command like `dagger call` from). Instead, these resources need to be explicitly passed when executing `dagger call`.

This includes: (TODO:(sipsma) include code examples here? Or just link somewhere else?)
1. Files + Directories - Functions can accept arguments of type `File` or `Directory`. You can pass files and directories on your host by specifying their path as the value of the argument when using `dagger call`.
1. Environment variables - You can pass environment variable values as argument values when invoking a function by just using the standard shell convention of using `$ENV_VAR_NAME` when using `dagger call`.
   * An argument of type `String` will handle any environment variable value, but other argument types may work with certain values of environment variables. For example, an environment variable whose value is a local path to a file or directory could be used for Function arguments of type `File` or `Directory`.
1. Local network services - Functions that accept an argument of type `Service` can be passed local network services in the form of `tcp://<host>:<port>`.
