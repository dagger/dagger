# IDE Integration

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

When you generate a Go module for the first time Dagger will create a `go.mod` file just for the module. If your module exists in a sub-directory of an outer Go project (such as `dagger/`, the default), this might confuse your editor.

If you already have a `go.mod` in the parent directory that you want to use instead, you can just delete the extra `go.mod` and `go.sum` - Dagger will use the parent one instead. This is not advisable if your module has certain dependencies that are not relevant to your core product, since most consumers will prefer a narrower set of dependencies.

If you want to keep the `go.mod` and be able to edit your module in the same editor session as your project code, you may want to set up a [Go workspace](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces):

```sh
# in the root of your repo
go work init
go work use ./
go work use ./path/to/mod
```

After restarting your editor you should now be able to use go-to-definition like normal even when editing `dagger/main.go` from your project root.

You probably don't want to commit `go.work`, so it is advisable to add it to your `.gitignore`:

```sh
echo go.work >> .gitignore
echo go.work.sum >> .gitignore
```
