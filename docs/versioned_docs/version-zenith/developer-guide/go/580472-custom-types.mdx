# Custom Types

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

A Dagger Module can have multiple object types defined. It's important to understand that they are only accessible through [chaining](./528510-chaining.mdx), starting from a function in the main object.

Here is an example of a function named `DaggerOrganization` that returns a custom `GitHubOrganization` type, itself containing a collection of `GitHubAccount` types:

```go file=./snippets/custom-types/main.go
```

Here's an example of calling this module to get all member URLs:

```shell
dagger call dagger-organization members url
```

The result will be:

```shell
https://github.com/jane
https://github.com/john
```
