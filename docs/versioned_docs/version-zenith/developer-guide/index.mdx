# Introduction

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

Dagger lets you encapsulate all your project's tasks and workflows into simple modules, written in your programming language of choice.

Start your journey into Dagger programming with the following resources:

- The quickstart
- The [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev), an online catalog of Dagger modules for you to use and learn from
- Guide on publishing modules to the Daggerverse
- Reference documentation for the [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/dagger.io/dagger) and [Python](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.org/) SDKs
