# Overview

Welcome to the Dagger developer guide!

This guide is intended for developers who want to add custom functionality to Dagger, either by creating a new Dagger Module or extending an existing one.

If you're just getting started, the learning path below will give you the essential information you need to understand and begin developing Dagger Modules in Go.

- Understand the [difference between Dagger Modules and Dagger Functions](../overview/382910-modules-vs-functions.mdx)
- Learn about the [architecture](../overview/482011-architecture.mdx) and [execution environment](../overview/942201-execution-environment.mdx) for Dagger Modules
- Read the documentation for developing Dagger Modules in one of the supported programming languages: [Go](../go/index.mdx), [Python](../python/index.mdx) or [TypeScript](../typescript/index.mdx)
