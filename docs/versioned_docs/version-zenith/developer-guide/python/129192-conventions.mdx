# Conventions

- A module's main functions can be declared as either top-level functions or as methods of a class (decorated with [dagger.mod.object_type](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#dagger.mod.object_type)) having the same name as the module (in PascalCase), but not both.
