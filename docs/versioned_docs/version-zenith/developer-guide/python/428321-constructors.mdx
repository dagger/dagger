# Constructors

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

Sometimes it's convenient to have a special function for constructing the main module object.

Here is an example module with a constructor:

```python file=./snippets/constructors/simple/main.py
```

And here is an example call for this module:

```shell
dagger call --name=Foo message
```

The result will be:

```shell
Hello, Foo!
```

## Asynchronous constructors

You can also use a constructor to enable use of asynchronous calls while initializing the object.

Here is an example module with a custom asynchronous constructor, which must be named `create`:

```python file=./snippets/constructors/async/main.py
```

And here is an example call for this module:

```console
dagger call grep --pattern=dagger
```
