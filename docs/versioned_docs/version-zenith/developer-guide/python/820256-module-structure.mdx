# Module Structure

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

It's essential to understand a few key concepts about Dagger Modules created for use with the Python SDK, for a better fit with your normal development workflow.

## Runtime container with Python 3.11

Dagger Modules run in a container (called the "runtime container") that's bootstrapped specifically by the Python SDK, with the necessary environment to run the module's code. It's currently hardcoded to run in Python 3.11 (although this may be configurable in future).

## Automatic SDK install

The Python SDK is installed automatically, including dependencies, with a version that's tied to the currently running Dagger Engine container[^1]:

```shell
# executed by the runtime container
pip install -e /sdk
```

This is why the initial `pyproject.toml` file doesn't include any [dependencies](./077133-python-dependencies.mdx).

[^1]: The SDK files are mounted under `/sdk` in the Dagger Engine runtime container.

## Modules as Python libraries

Dagger Modules in Python are built to be installed, like libraries. The runtime container installs the module code with:

```shell
# executed by the runtime container
pip install .
```

Due to [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) and [`pip` supporting `pyproject.toml`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/), this means that all package managers that support the [build backend](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#declaring-the-build-backend) standard are automatically supported.

For example, you can use [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/#build-system), [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#poetry-and-pep-517), or [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/reference/build/), to manage a module's dependencies and configure how it's built and installed.

Read more about this in the [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) tutorial.

### Required `main` in `site-packages`

The module's code isn't executed directly like a script, but it is rather imported under the hardcoded name `main` (although this may be configurable in future).

This means that after `pip install .`, there should be a Python module (or package) called `main` in the virtual environment's `site-packages/` directory inside the runtime container (`/opt/venv/lib/python-3.11/site-packages/main`).

This is the most important requirement. The other conventions are flexible, as long as the above is verified.

## Multiple files

You can split your Python module (`main.py`) into multiple files by turning it into a [package](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/):

```shell
mkdir src/main
mv src/main.py src/main/__init__.py
```

Ensure that Dagger sees it by importing it in `__init__.py`:

```python
# src/main/__init__.py
import dagger
from dagger import dag, function

from .test import Test  # in src/main/test.py
from .lint import Lint  # in src/main/lint.py
```

## Project name

The default project name in `pyproject.toml` is also `main`:

```toml
[project]
name = "main"
```

This is because most package managers use the name of the project to find the package to build, under `./src`. So, if you change the name of the project, you also need to make sure your chosen tool can find the package.

Here is an example of using a different project name with Poetry (truncated for brevity):

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "awesome-module"
packages = [{ include = "main.py", from = "src" }]
```

## Default project layout

The default template from `dagger init` creates a `main.py` file inside a `src` directory. This follows a [Python convention](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/) that requires a project to be installed in order to run its code, which prevents accidental usage of development code since the Python interpreter includes the current working directory as the first item on the import path (more information is available in this [blog post on Python pakaging](https://blog.ionelmc.ro/2014/05/25/python-packaging/)).

Tools like [build](https://build.pypa.io/en/latest/) (default), [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/), and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) already detect this project layout by default, but it's not required and can be overridden as long as `main` is installed correctly in `site-packages`, or is at least importable with `import main`.

Here is an example of moving the `main` package next to `pyproject.toml`, resulting in the following structure:

```
.
├── main
│  ├── __init__.py
│  ├── lint.py
│  └── test.py
├── dagger.json
└── pyproject.toml
```

In this case, it is necessary to to explicitly tell Poetry where to find the package, as shown below (truncated for brevity):

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "awesome-module"
packages = [{ include = "main" }]
```
