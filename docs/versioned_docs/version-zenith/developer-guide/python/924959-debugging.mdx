# Debugging


If you come across bugs, here are some simple debugging suggestions.

## Rerun commands with `--debug`

The Dagger CLI tries to keep its output concise by default. If you're running
into issues and want to debug with more detailed output, you can run any `dagger`
subcommand with the `--debug` flag to have it reveal all available information.

## Enable Pyton debug logs

The Python SDK prints debugging information at various steps of the execution
flow of a module, which can be very useful in understanding what's being
received from and sent to the API.

This is done using standard Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html),
so it's highly configurable (for example, saving to a file or sending to an
external system like Sentry). But for a simple lowering of the default logging
level to [logging.DEBUG](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.DEBUG),
there's a convenience function for that:

```python file=./snippets/debugging/main.py
```

:::note
With the TUI, you need to use a progress output that doesn't collapse on success
like `--progress=plain` or `--debug`, otherwise it won't show in the terminal.
:::

Using the command `dagger call --debug echo --msg="hello"`, should print
something like:

```
✔ MyModule.echo(msg: "hello"): String! 0.5s
  ✔ exec /runtime 0.5s
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.client._session: Configuring shared connection to GraphQL server
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.client._session: Establishing client session to GraphQL server
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: invoke => {'parent_name': 'MyModule', 'parent_json': '{}', 'name': 'echo', 'input_args': "{'msg': 'hello'}"}
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: resolver => MyModule.echo
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._resolver: func => <Signature (msg: str) -> str>
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._resolver: input args => {'msg': 'hello'}
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._resolver: structured args => {'msg': 'hello'}
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: result => 'hello'
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.mod._module: output => '"hello"'
  ┃ [DEBUG] dagger.client._session: Closing client session to GraphQL server
DEBUG: executing query="query{myModule{echo(msg:\"hello\")}}"
```

The above gives a lot of useful information:
- The function and parent object that the API wants to execute
- The parent object's state
- The function's signature
- The user inputs before and after deserialization
- The user inputs after being converted to more complex types (structuring)
- The function's result before and after serialization

Additionally, with `--debug` the GraphQL query that the CLI produced is also shown.

## Access the Dagger Engine logs

The Dagger Engine runs in a dedicated Docker container and emits log messages as it works. Here's how to access these logs:

```shell
DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER="$(docker container list --all --filter 'name=^dagger-engine-*' --format '{{.Names}}')"
docker logs $DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER
```
