# Chaining

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

Module functions can return custom objects, which in turn can define new functions. This allows for "chaining" of functions in the same style as the core Dagger API.

So long as your object can be JSON-serialized, its state will be preserved and passed to the next function in the chain.

Here is an example module:

```typescript file=./snippets/chaining/index.ts
```

And here is an example call for this module:

```console
dagger call with-name --name=Monde with-greeting --greeting=Bonjour message
```

The result will be:

```console
Bonjour, Monde!
```
