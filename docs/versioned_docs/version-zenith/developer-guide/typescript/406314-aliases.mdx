# Aliases

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

You can change the name of an exposed field or function to work around a reserved keyword or some other naming conflict, but still be able to expose the desired name in the Dagger API. For example, using `import_` in the language, but `import` in the Dagger API. To do so, simply add the alias as a parameter of the corresponding decorator.

Here is an example of a module with the field `ctr` aliased as `container` and the function `displayVersion` aliased as `version`:

```typescript file=./snippets/aliases/index.ts
```

Field and function names are overridden by their aliases in the output of `dagger functions`:

```shell
dagger functions
Name        Description
container   -
version     -
```
