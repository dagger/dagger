# Aliases

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

You can change the name of an exposed field or functions to make something more understable.  
To do so, simply add the name of your alias as a parameter of your decorator.

Here is an example of a module `HelloWorld` with the field `ctr` exposed as `container` and the function `displayVersion` exposed as `version`:

```typescript file=./snippets/aliases/index.ts
```

You can see that field and functions are overidden when you call `dagger functions`:

```shell
Name        Description
container   -
version     -
```
