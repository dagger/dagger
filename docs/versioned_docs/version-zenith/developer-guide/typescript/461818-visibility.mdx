# Visibility

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

TypeScript has some keywords to handle fields exposition in class (`private`, `protected` and `public`).
However, Dagger will only expose the fields of a modude that are explicitely exposed using the `@field()` decorators, the rest
will stay private in the context of your class.
Note that even if it's private, their state will still be loaded so you can use these fields without exposing them.

Here's an example of a module `Person` that has multiple properties not exposed outside the module and a function `identity` that use the `crypto` library to hash these:

```typescript file=./snippets/visibility/index.ts
```

If we execute `dagger functions`, we can see that `age` and `job` are not exposed:

```shell
dagger functions
Name       Description
identity   Get the identity of the person based on its personal information.
name       Get the name of the person
```

Here is an example of call to this module:

```shell
dagger call --name="john" --age=23 --job="devops"  identity
```

And the result is:

```shell
c11fb2dc1c5bfe34b0ed5737b8c58914ddb56a83602ead3eff2f06e46efc4a24
```
