# Module Constructor

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

Sometimes it's convenient to have a special function for constructing the main module object. This can, for example, be a simple way to accept module-wide configuration.

Here is an example module with a constructor:

```typescript file=./snippets/constructor/index.ts
```

And here is an example call for this module:

```shell
dagger call --name=Foo message
```

The result will be:

```shell
Hello, Foo!
```

:::note
Dagger Modules have only one constructor. Constructors of [custom types](./817191-custom-types.mdx) are not registered; they are constructed by the function that [chains](./129302-chaining.mdx) them.
