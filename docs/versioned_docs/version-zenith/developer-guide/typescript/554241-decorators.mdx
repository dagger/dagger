# Decorators

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

A module's main functions is declared as methods of a class (decorated with `@object()`) having the same name as the module (in PascalCase).

Every objects, functions (decorated with `@func()`) and fields (decorated with `field()`) with a decorator are exposed through the Dagger API to the user.

Here is an example of a module that exposes a function `alpine` that returns an object `Alpine` with the method `echo` and the field `ctr`:

```typescript file=./snippets/decorators/index.ts

```

And here is an example of call to this module:

```shell
dagger call alpine echo --msg="hello","world"
```

The reult will be:

```shell
hello world
```

But you could also directly query the field `ctr` to chain operations:

```shell
dagger call alpine ctr with-exec --args "echo","hello","world" stdout
```

This will output the same result as before:

```shell
hello world
```
