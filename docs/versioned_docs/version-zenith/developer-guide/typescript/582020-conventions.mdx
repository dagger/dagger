## Decorators

A module's main functions is declared as methods of a class (decorated with `@object()`) having the same name as the module (in PascalCase).

Every objects, functions (decorated with `@func()`) and fields (decorated with `field()`) with a decorator are exposed through the Dagger API to the user.

Here is an example of a module that exposes a function `alpine` that returns an object `Alpine` with the method `echo` and the field `ctr`:

```typescript file=./snippets/conventions/decorators/index.ts

```

And here is an example of call to this module:

```shell
dagger call alpine echo --msg="hello","world"
```

The reult will be:

```shell
hello world
```

But you could also directly query the field `ctr` to chain operations:

```shell
dagger call alpine ctr with-exec --args "echo","hello","world" stdout
```

This will output the same result as before:

```shell
hello world
```

## Default value for complex type

You might create a module that depends on some Dagger object such as `Container` and want to add a default value on
one of your field or function's arugment. In that case, you cannot use the classic TypeScript notation for default
argument in the field because it is not a primitive type.
The correct way to define a default object type as function argument is to use the `??` notation.

Here's is an example of a module with a default argument `ctr` of type `Container`:

```typescript file=./snippets/conventions/default-object-in-constructor/index.ts

```

You can also define a default value directly in the field:

```typescript file=./snippets/conventions/default-object-in-field/index.ts

```

:::note
You need to explicly declare the type even if you have a default value, the TypeScript SDK needs it to extend the GraphQL schema correctly.
:::

Here's an example of call for these modules:

```shell
dagger call version
```

And the result will be:

```shell
VERSION_ID=3.14.0
```
