## Default value for complex type

You might create a module that depends on some Dagger object such as `Container` and want to add a default value on
one of your field or function's arugment. In that case, you cannot use the classic TypeScript notation for default
argument in the field because it is not a primitive type.
The correct way to define a default object type as function argument is to use the `??` notation.

Here's is an example of a module with a default argument `ctr` of type `Container`:

```typescript file=./snippets/conventions/default-object-in-constructor/index.ts

```

You can also define a default value directly in the field:

```typescript file=./snippets/conventions/default-object-in-field/index.ts

```

:::note
You need to explicly declare the type even if you have a default value, the TypeScript SDK needs it to extend the GraphQL schema correctly.
:::

Here's an example of call for these modules:

```shell
dagger call version
```

And the result will be:

```shell
VERSION_ID=3.14.0
```
