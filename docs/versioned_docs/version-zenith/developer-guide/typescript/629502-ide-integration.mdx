# IDE Integration

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

When opening the generated `dagger/src/main.py` in an IDE, it may throw an error or a warning on account of not recognizing the `dagger` module. To resolve this, install the Python SDK in a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) from the generated `./sdk` directory, as shown below:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ./sdk
```

As always, you can use any virtual environment manager, including [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) and others. Just make sure you add `./sdk` as a development dependency. If you place the virtual environment inside the module, don't forget to add it to `.gitignore` and to `"exclude"` in `dagger.json`.

It's also important to install the SDK in editable mode (the `-e` in the `pip install` command) so you don't have to reinstall it after a `dagger develop`. However, it's always recommended to reinstall the SDK after upgrading Dagger to cover possible dependency changes.
