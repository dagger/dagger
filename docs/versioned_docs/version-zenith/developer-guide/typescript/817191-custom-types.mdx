# Custom Types

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

TypeScript has multiple ways to support complex data types. However, the Dagger TypeScript SDK only supports it through fields (decorated with `@field()`) inside classes because `type` and `interface` keywords do not allows decorators.

Here is an example of a function named `daggerOrganization` that returns a custom `GitHubOrganization` type, itself containing a collection of `GitHubAccount` types:

```typescript file=./snippets/custom-types/index.ts
```

Note that `GitHubOrganization` and `GitHubAccount` have no functions exposed, but these may be defined if needed.

Here's an example of calling this module to get all member URLs:

```shell
dagger call dagger-organization members url
```

The result will be:

```shell
https://github.com/jane
https://github.com/john
```
