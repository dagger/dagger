# Custom Types

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

TypeScript has multiple ways to support complex data type. However, the Dagger TypeScript SDK only support it through fields (decorated with `@field()`) inside classes because `type` and `interface` keywords does not allows decorators.

Here is an example of a module `HelloWorld` that has a function `daggerOrganisation` that returns a custom `GitHubOrganisation` type that has multiples fields exposed in it:

```typescript file=./snippets/custom-types/index.ts
```

Note that `GitHubOrganisation` and `GitHubAccount` has no functions exposed but you could define if you need to.

And here's an example of call to this module to get all members' url:

```shell
dagger call dagger-organisation members url
```

The result will be:

```shell
https://github.com/daggernaut
https://github.com/johnDoe
```

But since we have complex data type, we may need to retrieve multiples fields at the same time, to do so, you can use `dagger query`.

This query retrieves the organisation's url as well as its members' url and username:

```shell
echo '{helloWorld{daggerOrganisation{url,members{username,email}}}}' | dagger query
```

The result will be:

```shell
{
    "helloWorld": {
        "daggerOrganisation": {
            "members": [
                {
                    "email": "daggertnaut@dagger.io",
                    "username": "daggernaut"
                },
                {
                    "email": "john.doe@acme.io",
                    "username": "johnDoe"
                }
            ],
            "url": "https://github.com/dagger"
        }
    }
}
```
