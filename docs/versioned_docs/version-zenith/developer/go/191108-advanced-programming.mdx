# Advanced Programming

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

## Introduction

Once you've understood the basics of writing your own Dagger modules, you're going to inevitably want to learn more and do more. That's where this guide comes in. It shows you some of the more advanced techniques, tips and tricks you will need to supercharge your Dagger module development.

## Requirements

This guide assumes that:

- You have a good understanding of the Dagger Go SDK. If not, refer to the [Go SDK reference](https://pkg.go.dev/dagger.io/dagger).
- You have the Dagger CLI installed. If not, [install Dagger](../../reference/979596-cli.mdx).
- You have a Dagger module. If not, create a module using the [Go](../../developer/go/525021-quickstart.mdx) quickstart.
- You have Docker installed and running on the host system. If not, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Use modules in other modules

Modules can call each other. To add a dependency to your module, you can use `dagger install`, as in the following example:

```sh
dagger install github.com/shykes/daggerverse/helloWorld@26f8ed9f1748ec8c9345281add850fd392441990
```

This module will be added to your `dagger.json`:

```json
"dependencies": [
  {
    "name": "helloWorld",
    "source": "github.com/shykes/daggerverse/helloWorld@26f8ed9f1748ec8c9345281add850fd392441990"
  }
]
```

You can also use local modules as dependencies. However, they must be stored in a sub-directory of your module. For example:

```sh
dagger install ./path/to/module
```

The dependent module will be added to your code-generation routines, so you can access it from your own module's code, as shown below:

```go
func (m *Potato) HelloWorld(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
  return dag.HelloWorld().Message(ctx)
}
```

:::tip
Find modules on the [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev).

## Chain modules together

Module functions can return custom objects, which in turn can define new functions. This allows for "chaining" of functions in the same style as the [core Dagger API](https://docs.dagger.io/api/reference).

So long as your object can be JSON-serialized by your SDK, its state will be preserved and passed to the next function in the chain.

Here is an example module using the Go SDK:

```go file=./snippets/advanced-programming/chaining/main.go

```

And here is an example call for this module:

```console
dagger call with-name --name=Monde with-greeting --greeting=Bonjour message
```

The result will be:

```console
Bonjour, Monde!
```

## Write a module constructor function

Sometimes it's convenient to have a special function for constructing the main module object. This can, for example, be a simple way to accept module-wide configuration.

Here is an example module using the Go SDK:

```go file=./snippets/advanced-programming/constructor/main.go

```

And here is an example call for this module:

```console
dagger call --name=Foo message
```

The result will be:

```console
Hello, Foo!
```

:::note
If you plan to use constructor fields in other module functions, ensure that they are declared as public. This is because Dagger stores fields using JSON marshalling and private fields are omitted during the marshalling process. As a result, if a field is not declared as public, calling methods that use it will produce unexpected results.
:::

## Miscellanea

- The context and error return are optional in the module's function signature; remove them if you don't need them.
- A module's private fields will not be persisted.

## Conclusion

This guide showed you a few patterns and techniques you can use to improve your Dagger module programming skills.
