# Quickstart

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

## Introduction

<PartialDeveloperQuickstartIntroduction />

## Requirements

This quickstart assumes that:

- You have a good understanding of the Dagger Python SDK. If not, refer to the [Python](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.org/) SDK reference.
- You have the Dagger CLI installed. If not, [install Dagger](../../329058-install.mdx).
- You have Docker installed and running on the host system. If not, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Step 1: Initialize a new module

1. Create a new directory on your filesystem and run `dagger init` to bootstrap your first module. We'll call it `potato` here, but you can choose your favorite food.

    ```sh
    mkdir potato/
    cd potato/

    # initialize Dagger module
    dagger init --name=potato --sdk=python
    ```

    This will generate a `dagger.json` module file, initial `dagger/src/main.py` and `dagger/pyproject.toml` files, as well as a generated `dagger/sdk` folder for local development.

1. Test the module. Run the generated `main.py` with the `dagger call` command:

    ```sh
    dagger call container-echo --string-arg 'Hello daggernauts!' stdout
    ```

    :::tip
    When using `dagger call` to call module functions, do not explicitly use the name of the module.
    :::

:::note
When using `dagger call`, all names (functions, arguments, struct fields, etc) are converted into a shell-friendly "kebab-case" style.
:::

## Step 2: Prepare the development environment

:::note
If you don't need IDE support, you can skip this step.
:::

When opening the generated `src/main.py` in an IDE, it may throw an error or a warning on account of not recognizing the `dagger` module. To resolve this, install the Python SDK in a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments) from the generated `./sdk` directory, as shown below:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ./sdk
```

:::tip
As always, you can use any virtual environment manager, including [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) and others. Just make sure you add `./sdk` as a development dependency. If you place the virtual environment inside the module, don't forget to add it to `.gitignore` and to `"exclude"` in `dagger.json`.

It's also important to install the SDK in **editable mode** (the `-e` in the `pip install` command) so you don't have to reinstall it after a `dagger develop`. However, it's always recommended to reinstall the SDK after upgrading Dagger to cover possible dependency changes.
:::

## Step 3: Add a function

Let's try changing the `src/main.py` file.

1. Let's replace the auto-generated template with something simpler:

    ```python file=./snippets/quickstart/step2/main.py
    ```

1. Test the new function, once again using `dagger call`:

    ```sh
    dagger call hello-world
    ```

## Step 4: Use input parameters and return types

Your module functions can accept and return multiple different types, not just basic built-in types.

1. Update the function to accept multiple parameters (some of which are optional):

    ```python file=./snippets/quickstart/step3a/main.py
    ```

    The type annotation with the [Doc() metadata](https://peps.python.org/pep-0727/#specification) is used to document the parameter in the API.

    Here's an example of calling the function with optional parameters:

    ```sh
    dagger call hello-world --count 10 --mashed
    ```

1. Update the function to return a custom `PotatoMessage` type:

    ```python file=./snippets/quickstart/step3b/main.py
    ```

    Test it using `dagger call`:

    ```sh
    dagger call hello-world --message "I am a potato" message
    dagger call hello-world --message "I am a potato" from

    ```
    [dagger.mod.field](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#dagger.mod.field)
    is only needed to allow accessing the field directly via the API. Otherwise,
    it will still be used during serialization/deserialization when passing the
    object instance to other functions.

:::tip
Use `dagger call --help` to get help on the commands and flags available.

## Example: Write a vulnerability scanning module

The example module in the previous sections was just that - an example. Next, let's put everything you've learnt to the test, by building a module with a real-world application: scanning a container image for vulnerabilities with [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/).

1. Initialize a new module:

    ```shell
    mkdir trivy/
    cd trivy/
    dagger init --name=trivy --sdk=python
    ```

1. Replace the generated `src/main.py` file with the following code:

    ```python file=./snippets/quickstart/trivy/main.py
    ```

    In this example, the `scan_image()` function accepts four parameters:
      - A reference to the container image to be scanned (required);
      - A severity filter (optional);
      - The exit code to use if scanning finds vulnerabilities (optional);
      - The reporting format (optional).

    The function code performs the following operations:
      - It uses the default `dagger` client's `container().from_()` method to initialize a new container from a base image. In this example, the base image is the official Trivy image `aquasec/trivy:latest`. This method returns a `Container` representing an OCI-compatible container image.
      - It uses the `Container.with_exec()` method to define the command to be executed in the container - in this case, the `trivy image` command for image scanning. It also passes the optional parameters to the command. The `with_exec()` method returns a revised `Container` with the results of command execution.
      - It retrieves the output stream of the command with the `Container.stdout()` method and prints the result to the console.

1. Test the function using `dagger call`:
