# Constructors

## Asynchronous module constructor functions

Sometimes it's convenient to have a special function for constructing the main module object. This can, for example, enable use of asynchronous calls while initializing the object.

Here is an example module using the Python SDK with a custom asynchronous constructor, which must be named `create`:

```python file=./snippets/advanced-programming/constructor/main.py

```

And here is an example call for this module:

```console
dagger call grep --pattern dagger
```
