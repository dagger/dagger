# Use Dagger with GitHub Actions and Google Cloud

## Introduction

This guide teaches you how to create and use a custom Dagger Module to continuously build and deploy a Node.js application with GitHub Actions on Google Cloud Run. You will learn how to:

- Configure a Google Cloud service account and assign it the correct roles
- Create a Google Cloud Run service accessible at a public URL
- Create a Dagger module for your pipeline
- Run the Dagger pipeline on your local host to manually build and deploy the application on Google Cloud Run
- Use the same Dagger pipeline with GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the application on Google Cloud Run on every repository commit

## Requirements

This guide assumes that:

- You have a basic understanding of GitHub Actions. If not, [learn about GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
- You are familiar with programming in Go, Python or TypeScript and have the necessary development environment. If not, install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download).
- You have the Dagger CLI installed in your development environment. If not, [install the Dagger CLI](../329058-install.mdx).
- You have Docker (or an equivalent container runtime) installed and running on the host system. If not, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- You have a Google Cloud account and a Google Cloud project with billing enabled. If not, [register for a Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/), [create a Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/project) and [enable billing](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing).
- You have a GitHub account and a GitHub repository containing a Node.js Web application. This repository should also be cloned locally in your development environment. If not, [register for a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup), [install the GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) and follow the steps in Appendix A to [create and populate a local and GitHub repository with an example Express application](#appendix-a-create-a-github-repository-with-an-example-express-application).

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud service account

The Dagger pipeline demonstrated in this tutorial (re)builds a container image of an application every time a new commit is added to the application's repository. It then publishes the container image to Google Artifact Registry and deploys it at a public URL using Google Cloud infrastructure.

This requires the following:

- A Google Cloud service account with all necessary privileges
- A Google Cloud Run service with a public URL and defined resource/capacity/access rules
- A Google Artifact Registry repository
- Access to various Google Cloud APIs

## Step 5: Create the Dagger Module

The next step is to create a Dagger Module to do the heavy lifting: build a container image of the application, release it to Google Container Registry and deploy it on Google Cloud Run.

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="Go">

1. In the application directory, create a new Dagger module in a `ci` sub-directory.

    ```shell
    dagger init --name=my-module --sdk=go ci
    cd ci
    ```

1. Install the Google Cloud Run module.

    ```
    dagger install github.com/vvaswani/daggerverse/google-cloud-run
    ```

1. Update the generated `dagger/main.go` file with the following code.

    ```go file=./snippets/github-google-cloud/go/main.go
    ```

    This Dagger Module contains a constructor and three Dagger Functions. Let's look at each in detail.

    The constructor accepts a single argument, a `Directory` representing the directory containing the application source code. This argument is available to all the Dagger Functions in the Dagger Module.

    The `Build()` function takes care of building the application image.
      - It uses the client's `Container().From()` method to initialize a new container from a base image. In this example, the base image is the `node:21` image. This method returns a `Container` representing an OCI-compatible container image.
      - It uses the `Container.WithDirectory()` method to return the container image with the application source code written at the `/home/node` path, and the `Container.WithWorkdir()` method to set the working directory in the container.
      - It chains the `Container.WithExec()` method again to install dependencies with `npm install` and sets the container entrypoint using the `Container.WithEntrypoint()` method.

    The `Publish()` function takes care of publishing the container image to Google Artifact Registry.
      - It accepts four arguments: strings representing the Google Cloud project name, Google Artifact Registry location and Google Artifact Registry repository name, and a `Secret` representing Google Cloud credentials.
      - It invokes the `Build()` function to produce a `Container` representing the application image.
      - It uses the `Container.Publish()` method to publish the container to the Google Artifact Registry repository and returns the SHA identifier of the published image.

    The `Deploy()` function takes care of deploying the application to an existing Google Cloud Run service.
      - It accepts six arguments: strings representing the Google Cloud project name, Google Artifact Registry location, Google Artifact Registry repository name, Google Cloud Run service location, Google Cloud Run service name, and a `Secret` representing Google Cloud credentials.
      - It invokes the `Publish()` function to build and publish a `Container` representing the application image.
      - It uses the Google Cloud Run module to deploy the container image to the named Google Cloud Run service.

## Step 6: Test the Dagger pipeline on the local host

<PartialGoogleCloudSdkCredentialsSetup />

Once credentials are configured, test the Dagger Functions by running the command below from the application directory. Remember to update the `registry-location`, `repository`, `service`, and `service-location` arguments if you specified different values when creating the various Google Cloud services in Step 3 and Step 4.

```shell
dagger -m ci call --source . deploy --project myproject --registry-location us-central1 --repository myregistry/myapp --service-location us-central1 --service myservice  --credential env:GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
```

Dagger performs the operations defined in the Dagger Function, logging each operation to the console. At the end of the process, the built container is deployed to Google Cloud Run and the function returns the deployment URL. Browse to the deployment URL to see the running application.

If you deployed the example application from [Appendix A](#appendix-a-create-a-github-repository-with-an-example-express-application), you should see a page similar to that shown below:

![Result of running pipeline from local host](/img/current_docs/guides/github-google-cloud/local-deployment.png)

## Step 7: Create a GitHub Actions workflow

Dagger executes Dagger Functions in standard OCI containers. This means that a Dagger Function will always run the same way, whether on on your local machine or a remote server.

This also means that it's very easy to move the workflow you just encapsulated in Dagger Functions from your local host to GitHub Actions - all that's needed is to define a GitHub Actions workflow to call your Dagger Functions on every commit.

1. Commit and push the Dagger Module to the application's GitHub repository:

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -a -m "Added module"
    git push
    ```

1. In the GitHub repository, create a new workflow file at `.github/workflows/main.yml` with the following content:

    ```yaml file=./snippets/github-google-cloud/main.yml
    ```

    This workflow runs on every commit to the repository `master` branch. It consists of a single job with three steps, as below:
      - The first step uses the [Checkout action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout) to check out the latest source code from the `main` branch to the GitHub runner.
      - The second step downloads and installs the Dagger CLI.
      - The third step calls the `deploy()` Dagger Function with the required arguments.

One of the arguments to the Dagger Function is the Google Cloud JSON service account key, which is retrieved from a `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. As shown in the GitHub Actions workflow above, this environment variable is itself populated from a GitHub Actions secret. Create this secret as follows:

1. Navigate to the `Settings` -> `Secrets` -> `Actions` page in the GitHub Web interface.
1. Click `New repository secret` to create a new secret.
1. Configure the secret with the following inputs:
    - Name: `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`
    - Secret: The contents of the service account JSON key file downloaded in Step 1.
1. Click `Add secret` to save the secret.

![Create GitHub secret](/img/current_docs/guides/github-google-cloud/create-github-secret.png)

## Step 8: Test the Dagger pipeline on GitHub

Test the Dagger pipeline by committing a change to the GitHub repository.

If you are using the example application described in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-create-a-github-repository-with-an-example-express-application), the following commands modify and commit a simple change to the application's index page:

```shell
git pull
sed -i 's/Dagger/Dagger on GitHub/g' routes/index.js
git add routes/index.js
git commit -a -m "Update welcome message"
git push
```

The commit triggers the GitHub Actions workflow defined in Step 7. The workflow runs the various steps of the `dagger` job, including the pipeline script.

At the end of the process, a new version of the built container image is released to Google Container Registry and deployed on Google Cloud Run. A message containing the deployment URL appears in the GitHub Actions log.

Browse to the URL shown in the deployment message to see the running application. If you deployed the example application with the additional modification above, you see a page similar to that shown below:

## Conclusion

This guide walked you through the process of creating a Dagger Module to continuously build and deploy a Node.js application on Google Cloud Run. It explained key concepts, objects and methods available in the Dagger SDKs to create Dagger Functions.

Dagger executes Dagger Functions entirely as standard OCI containers. This means that Dagger Functions can be tested and debugged locally, and that the same Dagger Function will run consistently on your local machine, a CI runner, a dedicated server, or any container hosting service. This portability is one of Dagger's key advantages, and this guide demonstrated it in action by using the same Dagger Functions on the local host and on GitHub.

## Appendix A: Create a GitHub repository with an example Express application

This tutorial assumes that you have a GitHub repository with a Node.js Web application. If not, follow the steps below to create a GitHub repository and commit an example Express application to it.

1. Create a directory for the Express application:

    ```shell
    mkdir myapp
    cd myapp
    ```

1. Create a skeleton Express application:

    ```shell
    npx express-generator
    ```

1. Make a minor modification to the application's index page:

    ```shell
    sed -i -e 's/Express/Dagger/g' routes/index.js
    ```

1. Initialize a local Git repository for the application:

    ```shell
    git init
    ```

1. Add a `.gitignore` file and commit the application code:

    ```shell
    echo node_modules >> .gitignore
    git add .
    git commit -a -m "Initial commit"
    ```

1. Use the GitHub CLI to create a private repository in your GitHub account and push the changes to it:

    ```shell
    gh auth login
    gh repo create myapp --push --source . --private
    ```
