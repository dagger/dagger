### Rerun commands with `--focus=false`

Sometimes, the Dagger client logs are automatically collapsed and don't contain
all the information from a failure.

To make sure that logs aren't automatically collapsed, you can run any `dagger`
subcommand with the `--focus=false` flag to disable this behavior.

### Access the Dagger Engine logs

The Dagger Engine runs in a dedicated Docker container and emits log messages as it works. Here's how to access these logs:

```shell
DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER="$(docker container list --all --filter 'name=^dagger-engine-*' --format '{{.Names}}')"
docker logs $DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER
```
