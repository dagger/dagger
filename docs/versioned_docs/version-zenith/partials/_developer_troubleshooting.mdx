### Rerun commands with `--debug`

The Dagger CLI tries to keep its output concise by default. If you're running
into issues and want to debug with more detailed output, you can run any `dagger`
subcommand with the `--debug` flag to have it reveal all available information.

### Access the Dagger Engine logs

The Dagger Engine runs in a dedicated Docker container and emits log messages as it works. Here's how to access these logs:

```shell
DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER="$(docker container list --all --filter 'name=^dagger-engine-*' --format '{{.Names}}')"
docker logs $DAGGER_ENGINE_DOCKER_CONTAINER
```
