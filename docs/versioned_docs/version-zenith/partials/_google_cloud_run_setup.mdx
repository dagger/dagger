The next step is to create a Google Cloud Run service and corresponding public URL endpoint. This service will eventually host the container deployed by the Dagger pipeline.

1. From the navigation menu, select the `Serverless` -> `Cloud Run` product.
1. Select the `Create Service` option.
1. Select the `Deploy one revision from an existing container image` option. Click `Test with a sample container` to have a container image URL pre-filled.
1. Continue configuring the service with the following inputs, modifying them as needed:

    - Authentication: `Allow unauthenticated invocations`
    - CPU allocation and pricing: `CPU is only allocated during request processing`
    - Minimum number of instances: `0`
    - Maximum number of instances: `1`
    - Ingress: `Allow all traffic`

1. Click `Create` to create the service.

The new service is created. The Google Cloud Console displays the service details, including its public URL, on the service detail page, as shown below.

:::note
This guide assumes a project named `myproject` and a service named `myapp` in the `us-central1` region. These details are used as arguments to the Dagger functions in this guide; remember to update them based on the inputs you provided when creating the service.
