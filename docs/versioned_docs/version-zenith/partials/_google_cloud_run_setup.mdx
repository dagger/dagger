The next step is to create a Google Cloud Run service and corresponding public URL endpoint. This service will eventually host the container deployed by the Dagger pipeline.

1. From the navigation menu, select the `Serverless` -> `Cloud Run` product.
1. Select the `Create Service` option.
1. Select the `Deploy one revision from an existing container image` option. Click `Test with a sample container` to have a container image URL pre-filled.
1. Continue configuring the service with the following inputs:

    - Service name: `myapp` (modify as needed)
    - Region: `us-central1` (modify as needed)
    - Authentication: `Allow unauthenticated invocations`
    - CPU allocation and pricing: `CPU is only allocated during request processing`
    - Minimum number of instances: `0` (modify as needed)
    - Maximum number of instances: `1` (modify as needed)
    - Ingress: `Allow all traffic`

1. Click `Create` to create the service.

The new service is created. The Google Cloud Console displays the service details, including its public URL, on the service detail page, as shown below.
