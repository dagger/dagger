Create an environment variable named `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` and set it to the contents of the service account JSON key file. This environment variable is then passed to the Dagger module as an argument, for use in the Google Cloud Run client library during the client authentication process.

Replace the `SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY-FILE` placeholder in the following command with the path to your service account JSON key file.

```shell
export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=`cat SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY-FILE`
```
