Create a Google Cloud service account, as follows:

1. Log in to the Google Cloud Console and select your project.
1. From the navigation menu, click `IAM & Admin` -> `Service Accounts`.
1. Click `Create Service Account`.
1. In the `Service account details` section, enter a string in the `Service account ID` field. This string forms the prefix of the unique service account email address.

1. Click `Continue`.
1. Click `Done`.

Once the service account is created, the Google Cloud Console displays it in the service account list, as shown below. Note the service account email address, as you will need it in the next step.

Next, create a JSON key for the service account as follows:

1. From the navigation menu, click `IAM & Admin` -> `Service Accounts`.
1. Click the newly-created service account in the list of service accounts.
1. Click the `Keys` tab on the service account detail page.
1. Click `Add Key` -> `Create new key`.
1. Select the `JSON` key type.
1. Click `Create`.

The key file is created and automatically downloaded to your local host through your browser as a JSON file.
