# Quickstart

## Use modules from the Daggerverse

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

As you've seen in previous sections, modules can be consumed from remote sources like GitHub, or installed and used locally. The [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev) is an online catalog of Dagger modules that enables users to easily discover and use modules created by the Dagger community.

All Dagger CLI commands work as expected with Daggerverse URLs. Here are a few more examples for you to try:

- [Publish a container to the ttlsh registry](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/shykes/daggerverse/ttlsh): `dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/ttlsh publish --ctr alpine:latest`
- [Play a game of yamlinvaders](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders): `dagger call -m github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders play shell`
- [Stitch videos together](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/marcosnils/daggerverse/videostitch): `wget -q https://download.samplelib.com/mp4/sample-5s.mp4 && wget -q https://download.samplelib.com/mp4/sample-10s.mp4 && dagger call -m github.com/marcosnils/daggerverse/videostitch@main -o output.mp4 stitch --src-dir .`
- [Scan a container image for vulnerabilities](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy): `dagger call -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy scan-image --image-ref alpine/git:latest`

You can also add your own module to the Daggerverse, for others in the community to use and extend. You'll find more information on how to do this in our [guide on publishing modules to the Daggerverse](../developer/821742-publishing-modules.mdx).
