## Pass arguments to a function

Dagger Functions, just like regular functions, can accept arguments. In addition to basic types (string, boolean, integer, arrays...), Dagger also defines powerful core types which functions can use for their arguments: `Directory`, `Container`, `Service`, and `Secret`.

When calling a function from the CLI, its arguments are exposed as command-line flags. How the flag is interpreted depends on the argument type.

### List available arguments

To list available arguments for a function, use `dagger call FUNC --help`. The Dagger CLI will dynamically inspect the function's arguments, and print the corresponding flag information.

For example, inspect the arguments of the `hello` function you called earlier:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello --help
```

You should see output that looks like this:

```shell
✔ dagger call hello [0.00s]
┃ Say hello to the world!
┃
┃ Usage:
┃   dagger call hello [flags]
┃
┃ Flags:
┃       --figlet-container Container   Optional container for running the figlet tool
┃       --giant                        Encode the message in giant multi-character letters
┃       --greeting string              An optional greeting (default is "hello")
┃       --name string                  An optional name (default is "world")
┃       --shout                        Make the message uppercase, and add more exclamation
┃                                      points
```

### Pass a string argument

To pass a string argument to a function, add the corresponding flag to your `dagger call` command, followed by the string value.

Let's pass two arguments to our `hello` function, from the list we saw above:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello --greeting bonjour --name daggernaut
```

You should see the following output:

```shell
✔ dagger call hello [0.62s]
┃ bonjour, daggernaut!
```

### Pass a boolean argument

To pass a boolean argument from the command-line, simply add the corresponding flag, like so:

- To set the argument to `true`: `--foo=true`, or simply `--foo`
- To set the argument to `false`: `--foo=false`

Let's try this with the `giant` argument to our `hello` function:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello --greeting bonjour --name daggernaut --giant
```

You should see the same output as before, but in giant letters!

```shell
✔ dagger call hello [2.72s]
┃  _                  _
┃ | |__   ___  _ __  (_) ___  _   _ _ __
┃ | '_ \ / _ \| '_ \ | |/ _ \| | | | '__|
┃ | |_) | (_) | | | || | (_) | |_| | | _
┃ |_.__/ \___/|_| |_|/ |\___/ \__,_|_|( )
┃                  |__/               |/
┃      _                                               _   _
┃   __| | __ _  __ _  __ _  ___ _ __ _ __   __ _ _   _| |_| |
┃  / _` |/ _` |/ _` |/ _` |/ _ \ '__| '_ \ / _` | | | | __| |
┃ | (_| | (_| | (_| | (_| |  __/ |  | | | | (_| | |_| | |_|_|
┃  \__,_|\__,_|\__, |\__, |\___|_|  |_| |_|\__,_|\__,_|\__(_)
┃              |___/ |___/
```

### Pass a container as argument

It's now time to start exploring some of the features that make Dagger unique.

In addition to basic types, Dagger defines powerful core types, such as `Container`, which represents the state of an OCI container. This type provides a complete API for building, running and distributing containers. And, like any other type, a function can use `Container` for its arguments.

This means that *a function can receive containers as arguments*. To be clear: this is not a string referencing an image on a remote registry. It is the actual state of a container, managed by the Dagger Engine, and passed to a function's code as if it were just another variable. This feature, as far as we know, is unique to Dagger, and opens endless possibilities for assembling complex pipelines where container state flows from function to function - in just a few lines of code.

This feature is most powerful when calling a function from your own code (see the section on [creating a module](./428201-custom-modules.mdx)). But you can also pass a container argument from the command-line. To do so, add the corresponding flag, followed by the address of an OCI image. The CLI will dynamically pull the image, and pass the resulting container object as argument to the function.

Try this with the `hello` function. In order to print giant letters, it dynamically executes the `figlet` utility in a container and returns the container's output. By default, it builds a container with `figlet` installed; but it also supports passing a custom container, with the `figletContainer` argument.

Try calling `hello` with a custom container which has the `figlet` tool installed:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello --greeting bonjour --name daggernaut --giant --figlet-container index.docker.io/hairyhenderson/figlet
```

You should see the image being pulled, then the following output:

```shell
✔ dagger call hello [1.22s]
┃  _                  _
┃ | |__   ___  _ __  (_) ___  _   _ _ __
┃ | '_ \ / _ \| '_ \ | |/ _ \| | | | '__|
┃ | |_) | (_) | | | || | (_) | |_| | | _
┃ |_.__/ \___/|_| |_|/ |\___/ \__,_|_|( )
┃                  |__/               |/
┃      _                                               _   _
┃   __| | __ _  __ _  __ _  ___ _ __ _ __   __ _ _   _| |_| |
┃  / _` |/ _` |/ _` |/ _` |/ _ \ '__| '_ \ / _` | | | | __| |
┃ | (_| | (_| | (_| | (_| |  __/ |  | | | | (_| | |_| | |_|_|
┃  \__,_|\__,_|\__, |\__, |\___|_|  |_| |_|\__,_|\__,_|\__(_)
┃              |___/ |___/
⧗ 3.20s ✔ 73 ∅ 9
```

It worked! What happens if you pass a container that doesn't have the required tool installed?

```shell
dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/hello@v0.1.2 call hello --giant --greeting bonjour --name daggernaut --figlet-container index.docker.io/alpine
```

You should see an error telling you that `figlet` could not be found:

```shell
✘ dagger call hello ERROR [0.98s]
[...]
✘ stdout ERROR [0.13s]
✘ exec figlet Hello, world! ERROR [0.11s]
┃ exec: "figlet": executable file not found in $PATH
```

### Pass a directory as argument

Another example is the `Directory` type, representing a directory. To see how this works, use the following command:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/vikram-dagger/daggerverse/fileutils call tree --dir .
```

This example uses a file utility module and calls its `Tree()` function. The `Tree()` function accepts a directory (here, the current working directory) as argument and returns a tree representation of that directory. An abbreviated example of the output is shown below:

```shell
✔ dagger call tree [31.01s]
┃ .
┃ ├── README.md
┃ ├── cli
┃ │   └── git-build
┃ │       ├── README.md
┃ │       └── build.sh
┃ └── sdk
┃     ├── go
┃     │   ├── aws-cdk
┃     │   │   ├── README.md
...
┃ 39 directories, 125 files
```

You can also pass a remote Git reference, and the Dagger CLI will convert it to a `Directory` referencing the contents of that repository. For example, let's try listing the source code for the Dagger CLI, from the `main` branch of the Dagger GitHub repository:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/vikram-dagger/daggerverse/fileutils call tree --dir https://github.com/dagger/dagger#main:cmd/dagger
```

You should see the same file listing as [this GitHub page](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/main/cmd/dagger):

```shell
✔ dagger call tree [1.15s]
┃ .
