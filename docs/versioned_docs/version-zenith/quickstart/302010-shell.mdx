## Start an interactive shell in a container from a function

The `dagger shell` command can be used to open an interactive shell session with any container returned by a function.

This is very useful for debugging and experimenting since it allows you to interact with containers directly at any stage of your Dagger pipeline.

:::info
By default, `dagger shell` will execute the container's entrypoint, but you can override this with the `--entrypoint` flag.
:::

Try it with the command below:

```shell
dagger shell package --entrypoint /bin/sh
```

This command drops you into an interactive shell, allowing you to directly execute commands in the container returned by the `package` function, as shown below:

```shell
/ # cd /usr/share/nginx/html
/usr/share/nginx/html # pwd
/usr/share/nginx/html
/usr/share/nginx/html # ls
50x.html     assets       favicon.ico  index.html
/usr/share/nginx/html # uname -a
Linux rfcumveke37jk.6nr0lrfbb1khs.dagger.local 6.2.0-39-generic #40-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Nov 14 14:18:00 UTC 2023 x86_64 Li
nux
/usr/share/nginx/html # exit
```

:::caution
While most terminal programs such as `htop` or `vim` work with `dagger shell`, you may experience visual bugs with some programs due to terminal emulator incompatibilities.
