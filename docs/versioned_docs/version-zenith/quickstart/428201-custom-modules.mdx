## Create your first module

So far, you've been calling Dagger Functions using the Dagger CLI. However, you can also call Dagger Functions through code, by creating your own Dagger module and installing other modules into it. This allows you to express more complex workflows and operations by reusing modules created by others and connecting them together using the programming language you're most comfortable with.

In the previous sections, you've used the Dagger CLI to call Dagger Functions to build a Go binary from a remote repository and export it to your local filesystem, and to build and publish a container image to a registry. But what if you wanted to combine these operations (and other) into a single workflow?

One approach is to use multiple Dagger CLI calls (similar to what you've used in previous sections) and connect them together using shell scripts. However, this approach is not recommended, because you will typically end up with long and unwieldy CLI commands and shell scripting "glue" that is hard to debug and maintain.

A better approach is to create a programmable Dagger module, which can then call other Dagger modules and functions to achieve the required results. Creating your own Dagger module enables you to transform your workflows into structured, discrete and composable units with clear inputs and outputs, with all the benefits of using a native programming language.

To see this in action, create a custom Dagger module to build a Go binary, add it to a container image and publish the container image to a registry.

1. Begin by creating a new directory for your Dagger module and running `dagger init` to bootstrap a new module:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="Go">

    ```shell
    mkdir my-module
    dagger init --name=my-module --sdk=go
    ```

    This will generate a `dagger.json` module file, an initial `dagger/main.go` source file, as well as a generated `dagger/dagger.gen.go` and `dagger/querybuilder` directory for the generated module code.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Python">

    ```shell
    mkdir my-module
    dagger init --name=my-module --sdk=python
    ```

    This will generate a `dagger.json` module file, initial `dagger/src/main.py` and `dagger/pyproject.toml` files, as well as a generated `dagger/sdk` folder for local development.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="TypeScript">

    ```shell
    mkdir my-module
    dagger init --name=my-module --sdk=typescript
    ```

    This will generate a `dagger.json` module file, initial `dagger/src/index.ts`, `dagger/package.json` and `dagger/tsconfig.json` files, as well as a generated `dagger/sdk` folder for local development.

1. Dagger lets you add dependencies to your modules, so that you can build on modules created by others. Add the `golang` and `wolfi` modules as dependencies in your new module using `dagger install`:

    ```shell
    dagger install github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang
    dagger install github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi
    ```

1. Update the generated module template:

    <Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="Go">

    Update `main.go` with the following code:

    ```go file=./snippets/create/go/main.go
    ```

    This new `BuildAndPublish()` function accepts three arguments - the source directory, a list of build arguments and the path to the compiled binary file - and does the following:

    - It invokes the `Golang` module via the `dag` Dagger client.
    - It calls the module's `WithProject()` and `Build()` functions to build the remote directory. As you've seen already, the `Build()` function returns a `Directory` representing the state of the filesystem following the build.
    - It calls the `Directory.File()` method to return a reference to the compiled binary file.
    - It invokes the `Wolfi` module via the `dag` client.
    - It calls the module's `Base()` and `Container()` functions to return a new Wolfi container image as a `Container`.
    - It calls the `Container.WithFile()` method to add the compiled binary file to the container image's filesystem. This method returns a new `Container` with the result.
    - It calls the `Container.Publish()` method to publish the container image to the registry and print the SHA identifier of the published image.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Python">

    Update `src/main.py` with the following code:

    ```python file=./snippets/create/python/main.py
    ```

    This new `build_and_publish()` function accepts three arguments - the source directory, a list of build arguments and the path to the compiled binary file - and does the following:

    - It invokes the `Golang` module via the `dag` Dagger client.
    - It calls the module's `with_project()` and `build()` functions to build the remote directory. As you've seen already, the `build()` function returns a `Directory` representing the state of the filesystem following the build.
    - It calls the `Directory.file()` method to return a reference to the compiled binary file.
    - It invokes the `Wolfi` module via the `dag` client.
    - It calls the module's `base()` and `container()` functions to return a new Wolfi container image as a `Container`.
    - It calls the `Container.with_file()` method to add the compiled binary file to the container image's filesystem. This method returns a new `Container` with the result.
    - It calls the `Container.publish()` method to publish the container image to the registry and print the SHA identifier of the published image.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="TypeScript">

    Update `src/index.ts` with the following code:

    ```typescript file=./snippets/create/typescript/index.ts
    ```

    This new `buildAndPublish()` function accepts three arguments - the source directory, a list of build arguments and the path to the compiled binary file - and does the following:

    - It invokes the `Golang` module via the `dag` Dagger client.
    - It calls the module's `withProject()` and `build()` functions to build the remote directory. As you've seen already, the `build()` function returns a `Directory` representing the state of the filesystem following the build.
    - It calls the `Directory.file()` method to return a reference to the compiled binary file.
    - It invokes the `Wolfi` module via the `dag` client.
    - It calls the module's `base()` and `container()` functions to return a new Wolfi container image as a `Container`.
    - It calls the `Container.withFile()` method to add the compiled binary file to the container image's filesystem. This method returns a new `Container` with the result.
    - It calls the `Container.publish()` method to publish the container image to the registry and print the SHA identifier of the published image.

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

Call the new function using the Dagger CLI:

```shell
dagger call build-and-publish --build-src https://github.com/dagger/dagger --build-args ./cmd/dagger --out-file ./dagger
```

Here's an example of the output you should see:

```shell
✔ dagger call build-and-publish [3m35.8s]
┃ ttl.sh/my-dagger-container-3056246@sha256:ef0ffb71286be8c51e3d432fb9428ce46c80a32e8456dc963d0
┃ 1798fcba1e880
```

Test the published container image using the command below (remember to update the image name based on the function output):

```shell
docker run --rm -it ttl.sh/my-dagger-container-3056246 dagger version
```

Well done! You've just successfully written your first Dagger module and function!

:::info
When you install one module in another, Dagger exposes its functions using a language-agnostic GraphQL API. This means that any module is usable from any other module, regardless of whether they use the same programming language or not - for example, you can use a Python module from Go, or a TypeScript module from Python. This also means that you no longer care which language your CI tooling is written in; you can use the one that you're most comfortable with or that best suits the requirements at hand. [Learn more about how Dagger works](../index.mdx#how-does-it-work).
