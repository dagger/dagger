Modules can contain one or more functions. Module functions can accept and return both basic built-in types and more complex custom types.

Modules can call each other. Dagger lets you add dependencies to your modules, so that you can build on modules created by others.

This module defines a function named `HelloFromDagger()` which returns a string. This function performs the following operations:


This first example is fairly simple: it creates a Dagger module that initializes a Node.js container, executes a command in that container, and prints the output.

Begin by running `dagger mod init` in your application directory to bootstrap a new module using the Dagger Go SDK:

```shell
cd hello-dagger
dagger mod init --name=my-module --sdk=go
```

This will generate a `dagger.json` module file, an initial `main.go` source file, as well as a generated `dagger.gen.go` and `querybuilder` directory for the generated module code.

Update the generated `main.go` file with the following code:
