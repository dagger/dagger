## Conclusion

Over the last few pages, this tutorial has walked you, step by step, through the process of creating a Dagger module from scratch to test, build and publish a Node.js application image. It explained how to create a module and add functions to it. It also demonstrated the key features of the Dagger CLI, including how to create interactive shell sessions with running functions and expose services in functions to the host. Finally, it introduced you to the Daggerverse and showed you how to reuse functionality developed by the broader Dagger community.
