## Conclusion

Over the last few pages, this tutorial has walked you through the basics of using Dagger functions and modules. It introduced you to the Dagger CLI and the `dagger call` command, and demonstrated how to use it to call and chain functions together. It also showed you how to create a Dagger module from scratch to compile a binary file, containerize it and publish it. Finally, it introduced you to the Daggerverse and showed you how to reuse functionality developed by the broader Dagger community.
