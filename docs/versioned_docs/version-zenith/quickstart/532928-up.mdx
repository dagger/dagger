## Expose services returned by a function on the host

The `dagger up` command allows a service returned by a function to be executed and have any exposed ports forwarded to the host machine. This has many potential use cases, such as manually testing web servers or databases directly from the host browser or host system.

In order for this to work, the function must return a `Service` object and the associated `Container` object must have the `Container.withExposedPort` field defining one or more exposed ports. The second condition is already implemented in the `Package()` function shown earlier. So, all that's needed is to update the module and add a new `PackageService()` function returning a service, as shown below:

```go file=snippets/up/main.go
```

This function calls the `Container.AsService()` method on the `Container` object returned by the previous `Package()` function and returns the corresponding `Service` object.

Try it with the command below:

```shell
dagger up --port 8080:80 package-service
```

This command builds and packages the Vue application and serves it with NGINX, mapping container port 80 to host port 8080. You should now be able to see the Vue application's welcome page by browsing to `http://localhost:8080` on the host (replace `localhost` with your Docker host's network name if accessing it remotely).

:::info
The `--port` flag lets you explicitly map container ports to host ports when setting up network listeners on your host. This example exposes the service running on container port 80 at host port 8080. However, you can modify this behavior by using the `--native` flag, which auto-maps exposed ports on the container to the same ports on the host.
