## Chain Dagger functions together

Returning a directory, by itself, isn't very useful. Typically, you will want something from the directory - in the previous case, the binary file produced at the end of the build process.

One of Dagger's key features is that the custom objects returned by module functions can, in turn, define new functions. This allows function calls to be "chained" together to achieve a specific result.

The `Directory` returned by the previous `Build()` function is a core type, which comes with a number of functions of its own - most notably, an `Export()` function, which exports the directory's contents to a specified path on the host.

To see this in action, try the previous command again, this time chaining an additional function call to `Export()` on the `Directory` returned by the first function call:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang --proj https://github.com/dagger/dagger build --args ./cmd/dagger export --path ./my-dagger-build
```

This revised command builds the Go binary and exports the build output directory to the Dagger host. Once the command completes execution, a new `my-dagger-build` directory is created in the current working directory on the Dagger host. This directory contains the built Go binary.

Validate the binary file by executing the following commands on the Dagger host:

```shell
cd my-dagger build
./dagger version
```

You should see output similar to the following, which confirms that you've just remotely built a development version of Dagger:

```shell
dagger devel (f11d17fb2) (registry.dagger.io/engine) linux/amd64
```


:::tip
As you've seen in the previous examples, Dagger modules can contain one or more functions, each with different arguments and return values. You can list all the functions available in a module with the `dagger functions` command, or append `--help` to any `dagger call` command to see a context-sensitive list of supported arguments and sub-commands. Try it with the Go builder module:

```shell
dagger functions -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang
dagger call -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang --proj https://github.com/dagger/dagger build --args ./cmd/dagger container --help
```
