# Quickstart

## Building binaries with a function
Not only can functions use Dagger's powerful core types in their arguments: they can use them in their return value as well.

This opens powerful applications to Dagger Functions. For example, a function that builds binaries would take a directory as argument (the source code) and return another directory (containing binaries).

### Call a builder function

Let's try calling this Go builder function:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang --proj https://github.com/dagger/dagger call build --args ./cmd/dagger

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang --proj https://github.com/dagger/dagger build --args ./cmd/dagger export --path ./my-dagger-build
```

This revised command builds the Go binary and exports the build output directory to the Dagger host. Once the command completes execution, a new `my-dagger-build` directory is created in the current working directory on the Dagger host. This directory contains the compiled Go binary.

Validate the compiled binary by executing the following commands on the Dagger host:

```shell
cd my-dagger-build
./dagger version
```

You should see output similar to the following, which confirms that you've just remotely built a development version of Dagger:

```shell
dagger devel (f11d17fb2) (registry.dagger.io/engine) linux/amd64
```
:::tip
As you've seen in the previous examples, Dagger modules can contain one or more functions, each with different arguments and return values. You can list all the functions available in a module with the `dagger functions` command, or append `--help` to any `dagger call` command to see a context-sensitive list of supported arguments and sub-commands. Try it with the Go builder module:

```shell
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang functions
dagger -m github.com/kpenfound/dagger-modules/golang call --help
```
