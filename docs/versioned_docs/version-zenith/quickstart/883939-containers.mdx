## Build a container with a function

Just as you can chain and return `Directory` types, you can also chain and return `Container` types in functions.

### Call a builder function

Try calling this function:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi base with-package --name cowsay container
```

This Wolfi container builder module exposes a number of functions:

- A `Base()` function that creates a base container image using the `cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base` container image;
- A `WithPackage()` function that installs additional packages in the base image;
- A `Container()` function that returns the container.

You can chain these functions together to build and return a Wolfi container image containing specific packages - in this example, the `cowsay` package. You should see the container being built and the packages being added, as shown below:

```shell
✔ dagger call base with-package container [5.00s]
┃ Container evaluated. Use "dagger call base with-package container --help" to see available sub-commands.
```

This means that the build succeeded, and a `Container` type representing the built container image was returned. And, like `Directory`, `Container` is a Dagger core type which comes with useful functions of its own.

### Start an interactive shell session with the container

One of the most interesting `Container` functions is `Shell()`, which can be used to open an interactive shell session with the container. This feature is very useful for debugging and experimenting since it allows you to interact with containers directly and at any stage of your Dagger function execution.

To see this in action, call the previous function again, this time chaining an additional function call to `Shell()` on the returned `Container`:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi base with-package --name cowsay container shell
```

This revised command builds the container image and then drops you into an interactive shell, allowing you to directly execute commands in the running container.

Verify this by executing the following command:

```shell
cowsay "dagger"
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```shell
 ________
< dagger >
 --------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

:::caution
While most terminal programs such as `htop` or `vim` work with `dagger ... shell`, you may experience visual bugs with some programs due to terminal emulator incompatibilities.

### Execute commands in the container

The `Container` type has a `WithExec()` function, which returns the container after executing a specific command inside it. So, you could achieve the same result as before (although non-interactively) by chaining a function call to `WithExec()` on the `Container` returned previously, as shown in the following command:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi base with-package --name=cowsay container with-exec --args "cowsay" --args "dagger" stdout
```

### Publish the container image to a registry

The `Container` type also has a `Publish()` function, which publishes the container to a registry. To see this in action, call the previous function again, this time chaining an additional function call to `Publish()` on the returned `Container`:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi base with-package --name=cowsay container publish --address ttl.sh/my-wolfi
```

The output will be a container image reference on the [ttl.sh container registry](https://ttl.sh), as shown below:

```shell
✔ dagger call base with-package container publish [10.38s]
┃ ttl.sh/my-wolfi@sha256:1da9eea134000de6b9afef7d812ced0d6f4ebe45db50c0f1afdac5864862ae56
```

Test the container image using the command below:

```shell
docker run --rm -it ttl.sh/my-wolfi cowsay "dagger"
```

You should see the output below:

```shell
 ________
< dagger >
 --------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```
