## Use functions with containers

Just as functions can return strings and directories, so too can they return containers. To see this in action, try the following command:

```shell
dagger shell -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi base with-package --name cowsay container
```

This Wolfi container builder module exposes a number of functions:
- A `Base()` function that creates a base container image using the `cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base` container image;
- A `WithPackage()` function that installs additional packages in the base image - here, the `cowsay` package;
- A `Container()` function that returns the container.

The example above chains these various functions together and returns a special Dagger `Container` type representing the base image plus additional packages. The interesting thing here is that the `Container` type is a core type, which comes with a number of functions of its own - in particular, a `Shell()` function, which can be used to open an interactive shell session with the running container.

:::tip
This feature is very useful for debugging and experimenting since it allows you to interact with containers directly and at any stage of your Dagger function execution.
:::

To see this in action, try the previous command again, this time chaining an additional function call to `Shell()` on the `Container` returned by the previous function call:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi base with-package --name cowsay container shell
```

This revised command builds the container image and then drops you into an interactive shell, allowing you to directly execute commands in the running container.

Verify this by executing the following command:

```shell
cowsay "hello"
```

You should see output similar to the following, which confirms that you're executing commands in the just-built Wolfi container image:

```shell
 _______
< hello >
 -------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

:::tip
The `Container` type also has a `WithExec()` function, which returns the container after executing a specific command inside it. So, you could achieve the same output as before by chaining a function call to `WithExec()` on the `Container` returned previously, as shown in the following command:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi base with-package --name=cowsay container with-exec --args "cowsay" --args "dagger"
```

:::caution
While most terminal programs such as `htop` or `vim` work with `dagger shell`, you may experience visual bugs with some programs due to terminal emulator incompatibilities.
