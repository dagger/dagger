# Quickstart

## Create the example application

The example application used in this tutorial is a simple TypeScript application created with the Vue framework.

Create the application using the command below, answering "Yes" to all the prompts:

```shell
npm create vue@latest hello-dagger
```

The example application will be created in the `hello-dagger/` directory.

If you prefer, you can clone the application repository from GitHub:

```shell
git clone -b zenith https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger.git
```
