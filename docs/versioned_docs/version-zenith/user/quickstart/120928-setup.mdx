# Quickstart

## Set up the example module

The example module used in this tutorial contains all the code necessary to test, build, and publish a simple React application.

Begin by cloning the module repository into your local development environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dagger/hello-dagger.git
cd hello-dagger
```

Cloning the repository locally makes it easy to explore and/or modify the module code, and is the recommended approach for this quickstart. However, if you prefer not to do this, you can instead use the following command, which exports the module location to an environment variable so that Dagger automatically uses it in all subsequent CLI commands:

```shell
export DAGGER_MODULE=github.com/dagger/hello-dagger
```
