# Quickstart

## Use the Daggerverse

<PartialExperimentalDocs />

Modules don't need to be installed locally. The [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev) is an online catalog of Dagger modules that enables users to easily discover and use modules created by the Dagger community.

You can `dagger call` a function from a module using its Daggerverse URL. Here's an example of using a module from the Daggerverse to perform a Trivy security scan of an image:

```shell
dagger call -m github.com/jpadams/daggerverse/trivy scan-image --image-ref alpine/git:latest
```

All Dagger CLI commands work as expected with Daggerverse URLs. Here are a few more examples for you to try:

- Publish a container to the [ttlsh](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/shykes/daggerverse/ttlsh) registry: `dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/ttlsh publish --ctr alpine:latest`
- Create and add packages to a [wolfi](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi) container: `dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi shell base with-package --name curl with-package --name cowsay container`
- Play a game of [yamlinvaders](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders): `dagger -m github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders shell play`

You can also add your own module to the Daggerverse, for others in the community to use and extend. You'll find more information on how to do this in our [guide on publishing modules to the Daggerverse](../../developer/821742-publishing-modules.mdx).
