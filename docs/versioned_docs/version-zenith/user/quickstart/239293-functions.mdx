## List available functions in a module

So far, you've been working exclusively with one sub-command of the Dagger CLI: the `dagger call` sub-command. However, the Dagger CLI includes a number of other sub-commands as well.

Let's start with `dagger functions`, which lists the functions available in a module. Try it with the module you just created:

```shell
dagger functions
```

Here's an example of the output:

```shell
✔ dagger functions [0.00s]
┃ object name   function name    description                 return type
┃ *Mymodule     hello            say hello                   String!
┃ *Mymodule     test             run unit tests              String!
┃ *Mymodule     build            create a production build   Directory!
┃ *Mymodule     package          create a production image   Container!
┃ *Mymodule     publish          publish an image            String!
