# Quickstart

## List available functions in a module

You're now ready to dive into Dagger and start exploring the Dagger CLI!

This first example is fairly simple. Use the `dagger functions` command to display the functions exposed by a module.

```shell
dagger functions
```

Here's an example of the output:

```shell
✔ dagger functions [0.00s]
┃ Name                Description
┃ app-container       The container image containing our production app, with built assets served by nginx.
┃ build               The directory containing the built app
┃ debug               A container w/ the built app and node toolchain for debugging
┃ publish-container   Publish the app-container (to ttl.sh)
┃ service             The app-container as a service for local testing
┃ test                Run the app's tests
```
