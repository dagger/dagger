# Quickstart

## Start an interactive shell in a container from a function

The `shell` API can be used to open an interactive shell session with any container returned by a function. This is very useful for debugging and experimenting since it allows you to interact with containers directly.

Try it with the command below:

```shell
dagger call debug shell
```

This command drops you into an interactive shell, allowing you to directly execute commands in the container returned by the `debug` function, as in the example below:

```shell
# ls
Dockerfile  README.md  node_modules  package-lock.json  package.json  public  src  tsconfig.json
# uname -a
Linux vtmeopf0atpc2.3jgto8svt9r6s.dagger.local 6.2.0-34-generic #34-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Sep  4 13:06:55 UTC 2023 x86_64 GNU/Linux
# pwd
/src
#
```

### Override the entrypoint

By default, `shell` will execute the container's entrypoint. If the container doesn't have an entrypoint, it will default to executing `sh`.

However, you can also override the command that is executed when the shell session starts via the `--args` argument. You can use this to (for example) drop into a `node` shell in the container returned by `debug`, rather than `sh`. Use the following command to understand how this works:

```shell
dagger call debug shell --args node
```

This command drops you into an interactive Node.js shell, allowing you to directly execute Node.js code in the running container, as in the example below:

```shell
Welcome to Node.js v16.20.2.
Type ".help" for more information.
> console.log("hello from node in a container")
hello from node in a container
undefined
>
```

:::caution
While most terminal programs such as `htop` or `vim` work with `dagger ... shell`, you may experience visual bugs with some programs due to terminal emulator incompatibilities at this time.

:::tip
Here are a few examples of using this command with modules from the [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev/):

- [Create a Wolfi container image, add packages to it and start an interactive shell](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi): `dagger call -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi base with-package --name curl with-package --name cowsay container shell`
- [Play an interactive game](https://daggerverse.dev/mod/github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders): `dagger call -m github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/yamlinvaders play shell`
