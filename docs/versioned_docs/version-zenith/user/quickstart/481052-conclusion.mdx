## Conclusion

creating a Dagger module from scratch to test, build and publish a Node.js application image. It explained how to create a module, add functions to it, and work with containers and services as function inputs and outputs. It also demonstrated how to use modules from the Daggerverse to speed up your module development, by reusing functionality developed by the Dagger community.


Over the last few pages, this tutorial has walked you, step by step, through the process of creating a Dagger module from scratch to test, build and publish a Node.js application image. It explained how to create a module and add functions to it. It also demonstrated the key feature of the Dagger CLI, including how to create interactive shell sessions with running functions and expose services in functions to the host. Finally, it introduced you to the Daggerverse and showed you how to reuse functionality developed by the broader Dagger community.
