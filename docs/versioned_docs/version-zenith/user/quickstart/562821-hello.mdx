## Create your first Dagger module

You're now ready to dive into Dagger and write your first module!

This first example is fairly simple: it creates a Dagger module that initializes a Node.js container, executes a command in that container, and prints the output.

Begin by running `dagger mod init` in your application directory to bootstrap a new module using the Dagger Go SDK:

```shell
cd hello-dagger
dagger mod init --name=mymodule --sdk=go
```

This will generate a `dagger.json` module file, an initial `main.go` source file, as well as a generated `dagger.gen.go` and `internal` folder for the generated module code.

Update the generated `main.go` file with the following code:

```go file=snippets/hello/main.go
```

This module defines a function named `Hello()` which returns a string. This function performs the following operations:

- It uses the `dag` client's `Container().From()` method to initialize a new container from a base image. In this example, the base image is `node:18-slim`. This method returns a `Container` initialized from that base image.
- It uses the `Container.WithExec()` method to define the command to be executed in the container - in this case, the command `node -v`, which returns the Node version string. The `WithExec()` method returns an updated Container with the results of command execution.
- It retrieves the output stream of the command with the `Container.Stdout()` method and assigns it to a variable. Since the `Container.Stdout()` method uses the `Context` type, the module imports the `context` package.
- It returns a message interpolating the variable (the Node version number) into a longer string.

:::info
`dag` is the Dagger client, which is pre-initialized. It contains all the core types (like `Container`, `Directory`, etc.), as well as bindings to any dependencies your module has declared. Exhaustive documentation is available for core types and methods in the [Go SDK reference](https://pkg.go.dev/dagger.io/dagger).
:::

Call the new function using the Dagger CLI:

```shell
dagger call hello
```

:::info
When using `dagger call`, all names (functions, arguments, fields, etc) are converted into a shell-friendly "kebab-case" style.
:::

Dagger performs the operations defined in the function and outputs the message below:

```shell
Hello from Dagger and Node v18.19.0
```

Well done! You've just successfully run your first Dagger function and module!
