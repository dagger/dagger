# Quickstart

## Introduction

Welcome to Dagger, an integrated platform to orchestrate the delivery of applications to the cloud from start to finish.

This tutorial introduces you to Dagger and the Dagger Engine, a programmable tool that lets you replace your software project's artisanal scripts with a modern API and cross-language scripting engine.

It walks you, step by step, through the different commands available in the Dagger CLI to work with Dagger modules. It shows you how to execute functions from modules and work with function outputs in new and powerful ways.

## What you will learn

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Install the Dagger CLI
- List available functions in a module
- Execute functions in a module
- Export function outputs
- Start an interactive shell in a container returned by a function
- Expose services or containers returned by a function on the host
- Use modules from remote sources

## Requirements

To use this tutorial, you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your host system.
