# Quickstart

## Add a function to build the application

If your application passes all its tests, the typical next step is to build it.

Add a new `Build()` function that creates a production build of the example application by running `npm run build`:


```go file=snippets/build/main.go
```

This function does the following:

- It starts off like the previous `Test()` function and obtains a `Node` object with the application source code, Node.js runtime and cache volumes.
- It calls the module's `Node.Build()` function, which returns a revised `Node` object after setting the `npm run build` command to run in the container image.
- It obtains a reference to the `dist/` directory in the container with the `Container.Directory()` function. This function returns a `Directory` object.

:::note
The `npm run build` command is appropriate for a Vue application, but other applications are likely to use different commands. Modify your function code accordingly. Remember that you can use the module's `Node.Run()` function to customize the command to be run.
:::

Call the new function using the Dagger CLI:

```shell
dagger call build
```

Here's an example of the output you will see:

```shell
✔ dagger call build [1m32.7s]
┃ assets
┃ favicon.ico
┃ index.html
• Engine: 378cfbb9549c (version v0.9.3)
⧗ 2m21.4s ✔ 121 ∅ 13
```

A quick aside: did you notice that the `Build()` and `Test()` functions share a lot of the same code? To make your module more reusable and maintainable, it's a good idea move this common code into a separate function, which you can invoke as needed.

Update your module with a new, private `buildBaseImage()` function that performs the basic operations needed by the `Test()` and `Build()` functions, and then update the `Test()` and `Build()` functions to use it:

```go file=snippets/build/main-improved.go
```

:::info
The `buildBaseImage()` function uses the `node` module and returns a custom `Node` object representing a container image with the application source code, Node.js runtime and cache volumes. This `Node` object can then be "chained" into other functions, in the same style as the [core Dagger API](https://docs.dagger.io/api/reference).
:::

After updating the module, test and build the application again:

```shell
dagger call test
dagger call build
```

You will see the same results as before.
