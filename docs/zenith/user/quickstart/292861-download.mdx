# Quickstart

## Export function outputs

The `dagger download` command allows you to retrieve file, directory and container outputs from functions and write them to the host filesystem.

To see it in action, use `dagger download` with the `build` function used previously, to export the built application to an `out` directory on the host:

```shell
dagger download --export-path ./out build
```

Here's an example of the output:

```shell
✔ dagger download build [31.79s]
┃ Asset exported to "./out"
$ ls out/
asset-manifest.json  index.html   logo512.png    robots.txt
favicon.ico          logo192.png  manifest.json  static
```

The `dagger download` command also works with functions that return `Container` types, in which case the `Container` is exported as a TAR file to the host file system. Here's an example:

```shell
dagger download --export-path ./container.tar app-container
```

* TODO collect one-liner `dagger download` statements that use different modules from daggerverse and show off more cool use cases
