# Quickstart

## Start an interactive shell in a container from a function

The `dagger shell` command can be used to open an interactive shell session with any container returned by a function.

This is very useful for debugging and experimenting since it allows you to interact with containers directly.

Use the `dagger shell` command to see how it works:

```shell
dagger shell debug
```

This command drops you into an interactive shell, allowing you to directly execute commands in the running container.

### Override the entrypoint

By default, `dagger shell` will execute the container's entrypoint. If the container doesn't have an entrypoint, it will default to executing `sh`.

However, you can also override the command that is executed when the shell session starts via the `--entrypoint` flag. You can use this to (for example) drop into a `node` shell in the debug container rather than `sh`. Use the following command to understand how this works:

```shell
dagger shell --entrypoint node debug
```

This command drops you into an interactive Node.js shell, allowing you to directly execute Node.js code in the running container:

```shell
Welcome to Node.js v16.20.2.
Type ".help" for more information.
> console.log("hello from node in a container")
hello from node in a container
undefined
>
```

:::caution
While most terminal programs such as `htop` or `vim` work with `dagger shell`, you may experience visual bugs with some programs due to terminal emulator incompatibilities at this time.

:::tip
Here are a few examples of using this command with modules from the [Daggerverse](https://daggerverse.dev/):

- `dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/wolfi shell base with-package --name curl with-package --name cowsay container`

- `dagger -m github.com/shykes/daggerverse/tmate shell wrap --container alpine:latest`
   - TODO: this one needs v0.9.3 and this PR to merged to work https://github.com/shykes/daggerverse/pull/6
