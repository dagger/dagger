# Quickstart

## Use modules from remote sources

Modules don't need to be installed locally. Dagger lets you consume modules from remote sources as well. For example, you can `dagger call` a function from a module using its GitHub URL:

```shell
dagger call test -m "github.com/sipsma/daggerverse@main"
```

Or, if the target module is in a subdirectory of the repository:

```shell
dagger call test -m "github.com/sipsma/daggerverse/example@main"
```

You can also use modules from the local filesystem, without needing to push them to GitHub. For example:

```shell
dagger call test -m "./path/to/module"
```
