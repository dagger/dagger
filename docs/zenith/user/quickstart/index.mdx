# Quickstart

## Introduction

Welcome to Dagger, an integrated platform to orchestrate the delivery of applications to the cloud from start to finish.

This tutorial introduces you to Dagger and the Dagger Engine, a programmable tool that lets you replace your software project's artisanal scripts with a modern API and cross-language scripting engine.

It walks you, step by step, through the process of creating a CI pipeline to test, build and publish an example application using a Dagger module. Through this process, you will learn the different commands available in the Dagger CLI and understand the basics of using Dagger modules.

## What you will learn

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Install the Dagger CLI
- Create Dagger functions to test, build and publish an application
- Inspect, test and debug functions in real-time
- Reuse existing functionality from the Daggerverse

## Requirements

To use this tutorial, you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your host system.
