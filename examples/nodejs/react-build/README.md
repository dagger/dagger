# React Build

This is based on the [Getting Started guide for Nodejs](https://docs.dagger.io/sdk/nodejs/783645/get-started#step-5-test-against-multiple-nodejs-versions)

A simple react app is created with `create-react-app` which is built and tested by `build.js` or `build.ts`.

Run:

`npm install`

and then:

`node --loader ts-node/esm ./build.ts`

or

`node ./build.js`
