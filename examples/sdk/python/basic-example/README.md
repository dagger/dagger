# Basic Example

Ideally, set up a Virtual Env with the Dagger Python SDK to run in:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip dagger-io
```

Then to run the example:
```
dagger run python test.py
```

The code in `test.py` is taken from [Step 2 of the Python SDK Getting Started Guide](https://docs.dagger.io/sdk/python/628797/get-started#step-2-create-a-dagger-client-in-python). For further instructions on running this example, please refer to the guide.
