## v0.13.0 - 2024-09-11


### ðŸ”¥ Breaking Changes
- Remove `appVersion` - this is now the chart version by @gerhard in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8348 \
  Customizing the Engine image is now done via `engine.image.ref` and requires
  the full image reference, including the registry URL. If you configure this
  value, you must ensure that this Engine image is compatible with the chart.
- Removes default `oci-max-parallelism` `num-cpu` Engine setting by @gerhard in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8406
  This option is known to be problematic in certain scenarios 

### Dependencies
- Bump Engine to v0.13.0 by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8408
