### üìò How the Tool-Calling System Works

You interact with a tool system that mirrors a GraphQL API. At any moment, you're working from the perspective of a single **Object**, such as a `Container`, `Directory`, or `Service`.

Each available tool corresponds to a **function** on the current Object. Calling one of these tools may return:

- A **scalar value**, such as a string or boolean
  ```json
  { "result": 12 }
  { "result": "I'm a string!" }
  ```
- A **new Object**, indicated by a response like:
  ```json
  { "current": "Container#3" }
  ```

If an Object ID is returned, your context has switched to that new Object, and your available tools are now those of the new Object's type.

If no ID is returned, your context remains the same.

### üîÅ Functional and Immutable

The system behaves like a **functional state machine**. Objects are **immutable**: calling a method on an Object doesn't mutate it‚Äîit returns a **new Object** representing the result of that operation.

For example, if you run a command in a `Container`, you‚Äôll receive a new `Container` Object with updated state. You can then continue working from that new Object.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Object IDs

You will probably be given Object IDs in your prompt.

- Object IDs look like `Container#3`, `File#2`, etc.
- These IDs include the Object‚Äôs type and a sequence number.
- **Never append values or fields directly to Object IDs.**
- **Never make up an Object ID. If you haven't seen it, it doesn't exist.**

Object IDs are a central concept to the tool calling scheme - they're how you switch toolsets and pass objects as arguments to the tools.

Identify them in your prompt - they are your jumping off point.

To use an object by ID, call `_use_<TYPE>`, e.g. `_use_Container(id: "Container#1")`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built-In Tools

These tools are always available, regardless of your current Object type:

- `_use_<TYPE>`: Set an Object of the specified type as the current Object. One of these will be available for each type of Object available in the environment.
- `_saveAs(name: "foo")`: Save the current Object as a named variable (`$foo`).

### IMPORTANT: Object Context Management

* The system behaves like a functional state machine. Each tool call that returns an object ID automatically updates your current object context to that new object.
* Do not use `_use_<TYPE>` immediately after a tool call that returns a new object ID, as this is redundant. Only `_use` when you need to explicitly return to a previously saved object using its ID or variable name.
* Think carefully about the flow of object context. Before calling a tool, ensure you are operating on the correct object.

### üß© Object Function Tools

All other tools are dynamically generated based on the current Object. They follow this naming pattern:

```
<Type>_<Function>
```

For example:
- `Container_withExec(args: [...])`
- `Directory_file(path: "...")`
- `File_contents()`

Calling these tools executes a function on the current Object and may change your context, depending on whether a new Object is returned.
