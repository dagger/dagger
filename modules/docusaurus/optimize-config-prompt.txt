In $workspace, inspect the Docusaurus config at $sitePath, starting with docusaurus.config.ts (or docusaurus.config.js).

Find all files paths that must be included outside of the site directory, for the build to succeed. For example, imported js files in other directories, data files opened at runtime, etc. If relevant, recursively inspect those files for transient dependencies. But look for opportunities to prune the search tree - if you read too many files, execution time will be too slow.

- Only access files from the workspace that you actually need - IO is expensive.
- For large files, when possible, try searching for specific regexps rather than reading the entire contents. Your token budget is not infinite.

You start with a list of known includes, at $knownIncludes. Update it based on the dependencies you find - make sure there are no duplicates. When you are done, return the modified include list as 'updatedIncludes'.

This is a headless automated task. Keep verbosity to a minimum. Just do the work without commentary.
