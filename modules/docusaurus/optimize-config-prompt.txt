In $workspace, inspect the Docusaurus config at $sitePath, starting with docusaurus.config.ts (or docusaurus.config.js).

Find all files paths that must be included outside of the site directory, for the build to succeed. For example, imported js files in other directories, data files opened at runtime, etc. If relevant, recursively inspect those files for transient dependencies. For example a js file might import more js files, etc.

Only access files from the workspace that you actually need - IO is expensive.

You start with a list of known includes, at $knownIncludes. Update it based on the dependencies you find - make sure there are no duplicates. When you are done, return the modified include list as 'updatedIncludes'.

This is a headless automated task. Keep verbosity to a minimum. Just do the work without commentary.
