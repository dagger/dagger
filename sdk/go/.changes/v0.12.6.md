## sdk/go/v0.12.6 - 2024-08-29

### Fixed
- Correctly handle CRLF line endings during comment parsing by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8217 \
  This previously could result in function argument doc-strings not being
  correctly found, and would interferet st with pragma parsing (e.g. `// +optional`
  and `// +default`).

### Dependencies
- Update to use [Go 1.23](https://go.dev/doc/go1.23) by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7670 \
  This allows using go 1.23 in modules.
