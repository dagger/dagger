## sdk/go/v0.17.0 - 2025-03-20

This SDK uses 🚙 Engine + 🚗 CLI version `v0.17.0`. [See what changed in that release](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/releases/tag/v0.17.0).

🐹 https://pkg.go.dev/dagger.io/dagger@v0.17.0

### Added
- New `sdk.config.goprivate` setting in `dagger.json` for go modules by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9323 \
  This setting allows configuring the `GOPRIVATE` env var in the context of building+running the module code, so that private dependencies can be loaded.
- Automatic forwarding of .gitconfig `insteadOf` directives into go module runtime by @rajatjindal in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9323 \
  In combination with `goprivate`, this can be used to load private dependencies.

### Dependencies
- Bump Engine to v0.17.0 by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9918
