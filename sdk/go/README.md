# Dagger Go SDK

The Dagger Go SDK contains everything you need to develop CI/CD pipelines in Go, and run them with the [Dagger Engine](https://dagger.io).

This SDK contains:

* A Go package: `dagger.io/dagger`
* The [`dagger` CLI][cli]
* [Examples][examples]
* [Documentation][docs]


## Contributing

The Dagger Go SDK is open-source, and we welcome contributions. Its source code lives in the [Dagger Engine repository][source].

> **NOTE**: please do NOT contribute to `github.com/dagger/dagger-go-sdk`: that is a read-only mirror which only exists to satisfy the requirements of the Go package management system. Instead, please visit the repository linked above.
