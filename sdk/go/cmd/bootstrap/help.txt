This command builds the Go SDK module runtime container image.

It is currently specific to the Go SDK, but it could be made generic in the
future, if that's useful.

First the module's runtime container is built natively using the Dagger client,
using very similar code to the module's own ModuleRuntime function.

Next, the freshly built runtime container is used to load and serve the module
to the local client.

Finally, the module's moduleRuntime function is invoked via GraphQL with the
same values provided to the native bootstrap.

The result of the module's moduleRuntime is then sync'd to verify it builds
correctly, and finally exported and/or published depending on what flags are
given.
