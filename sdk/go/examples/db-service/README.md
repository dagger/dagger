# Database Service in a Pipeline

This example shows the usage of a postgres database used in the integration tests for an application. The pipeline uses a postgres container as a service alongside the testing pipeline.

To run, `go run main.go`

This will start a dagger pipeline to run the tests in `main_test.go`
