## Usage

Since we cannot copy our local dagger library into the container that executes the command, for testing purpose we are copying `server.ts`
to the source file.

:bulb: Note that final users will simply import the function from `@dagger.io/dagger`.

To enable dagger project, you need to create a `dagger.json` file at the root of the project.

Here's an example

```json
{
  "name": "typescript test",
  "sdk": "typescript"
}
```

One command is currently available:

```shell
$ dagger do
┃ Loading+installing project...

## Notes

- I'm not sure we will be able to support entrypoint on javascript since there's no way to introspect function arguments types, so we cannot create a typed GraphQL schema. Maybe primitive types can be used but it is not supported by this current version. 

## To do

- [ ] Handle command execution
- [ ] Make errors more understandable
- [ ] Improve generator system to use a public library
- [ ] Find a way to import local library for integration tests
- [ ] Add tests
