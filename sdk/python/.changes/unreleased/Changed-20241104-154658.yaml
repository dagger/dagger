    New modules will get a package name based on the module name instead of being hardcoded to "main"

    Existing modules should work the same because "main" is used as a fallback. There's also a new setting (using a Python entry point) to precisely tell Dagger where the main object should be imported from.

    For example:
    ```toml
    # pyproject.toml

    [project.entry-points."dagger.mod"]
    main_object = "my_module.main:MyModule"
    ```
