  Default Python version in Dagger modules changed to 3.13 and build backend to uv_build

  The new Python version will only be used in new modules or older modules without
  a pinned Python version.

  To upgrade an existing module, update the minimum required Python version in
  `pyproject.toml`:
  ```toml
  requires-python = ">=3.13"
  ```
  Or make sure it's set to `">=3.12"` to remain on Python 3.12. 

  See the [Runtime container](https://docs.dagger.io/api/module-structure#runtime-container) 
  documentation for more information.
