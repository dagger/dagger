## sdk/python/v0.12.5 - 2024-08-15

### Deprecated
- `Arg` has been renamed to `Name` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8109 \
  For code that currently uses `Arg` to avoid a naming conflict with a reserved
  keyword, it can be removed since the SDK will strip the last `_` in an
  argument's name when interfacing with the API. For other needs, just rename
  `Arg` to `Name`.
