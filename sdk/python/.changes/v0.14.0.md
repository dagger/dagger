## sdk/python/v0.14.0 - 2024-11-08

This SDK uses 🚙 Engine + 🚗 CLI version `v0.14.0`. [See what changed in that release](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/releases/tag/v0.14.0).

🐍 https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/v0.14.0/
📖 https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-python-v0.14.0/


### Changed
- New modules will get a package name based on the module name instead of being hardcoded to "main" by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8709 \
  Existing modules should work the same because "main" is used as a fallback. There's also a new setting (using a Python entry point) to precisely tell Dagger where the main object should be imported from.
  
  For example:
  ```toml
  # pyproject.toml
  
  [project.entry-points."dagger.mod"]
  main_object = "my_module.main:MyModule"
  ```

### Deprecated
- In modules, the `index-url` and `index-extra-url` settings in `[tool.uv]` are now deprecated in favor of the new `[[tool.uv.index]]` setting by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8772
  

### Dependencies
- Bump Engine to v0.14.0 by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8900
