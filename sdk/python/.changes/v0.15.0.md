### 🔥 Breaking Changes
- `str(ExecErr)` no longer contains the values of `stdout` or `stderr` by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9033 \
  When comparing error values for expected output, use the more specific values.
- Removed the deprecated `index-url` and `index-extral-url` settings under `[tool.uv]` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9127 \
  These settings were deprecated in Dagger [v0.14.0](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/releases?q=tag%3Asdk%2Fpython%2Fv0) since uv [v0.4.23](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.4.23) replaced them with the `[[tool.uv.index]]` table. See [Package indexes](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/indexes/) for the full documentation.

### Fixed
- Fixed dagger init generating the wrong package name when using a module name that includes a number by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9000

### Dependencies
- Bump Engine to v0.15.0 by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9158
