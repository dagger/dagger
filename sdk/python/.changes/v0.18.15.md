### 🔥 Breaking Changes
- Improved error handling and reporting in Python modules with clearer error messages and better debugging support by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10532 \
  The root logger is now setup with a handler that will ultimately show as stderr output in visualization (TUI/Cloud) for the "warning" log level and above.
  
  There’s a possible breaking change if a non async function returns a coroutine. Marked as breaking out of caution as it should have low impact. This would work previously but it’s now validated to avoid confusion as it’s expected to be a mistake and not intentional. An `async` needs to be added to the function’s signature, and an `await` on the call that returns the coroutine (value returned by an async function).

### Changed
- Default Python version in Dagger modules changed to 3.13 and build backend to uv_build by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10825 \
  The new Python version will only be used in new modules or older modules without
  a pinned Python version.
  
  To upgrade an existing module, update the minimum required Python version in
  `pyproject.toml`:
  ```toml
  requires-python = ">=3.13"
  ```
  Or make sure it's set to `">=3.12"` to remain on Python 3.12. 
  
  See the [Runtime container](https://docs.dagger.io/api/module-structure#runtime-container) 
  documentation for more information.
