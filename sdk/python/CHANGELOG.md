## sdk/python/v0.14.0 - 2024-11-08

This SDK uses 🚙 Engine + 🚗 CLI version `v0.14.0`. [See what changed in that release](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/releases/tag/v0.14.0).

🐍 https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/v0.14.0/
📖 https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-python-v0.14.0/


### Changed
- New modules will get a package name based on the module name instead of being hardcoded to "main" by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8709 \
  Existing modules should work the same because "main" is used as a fallback. There's also a new setting (using a Python entry point) to precisely tell Dagger where the main object should be imported from.
  
  For example:
  ```toml
  # pyproject.toml
  
  [project.entry-points."dagger.mod"]
  main_object = "my_module.main:MyModule"
  ```

### Deprecated
- In modules, the `index-url` and `index-extra-url` settings in `[tool.uv]` are now deprecated in favor of the new `[[tool.uv.index]]` setting by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8772

## sdk/python/v0.13.0 - 2024-09-11

This SDK uses 🚙 Engine + 🚗 CLI version `v0.13.0`. [See what changed in that release](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/releases/tag/v0.13.0).

🐍 https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/v0.13.0/
📖 https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-python-v0.13.0/


### Changed
- Use `uv.lock` by default in new Dagger Modules by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8311 \
  Simpler workflow with uv:

  ```
  dagger init --sdk=python my-module
  cd my-module
  uv run vim .
  ```
  
  To replace `uv.lock` with `requirements.lock`:

  ```
  uv export --no-dev --no-emit-workspace --no-emit-package=dagger-io -o requirements.lock
  uv remove dagger-io
  rm uv.lock
  ```
  
  To migrate an existing module to `uv.lock`:

  ```
  dagger develop
  uv add --editable ./sdk
  uv run vim .
  ```
  
  If both files exist, `uv.lock` will take precedence.
- Modules run in Python 3.12 by default by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8311 \
  To pin to Python 3.11 in a module, either change `requires-python = ">=3.11"` in `pyproject.toml` or create a `.python-version` file with `3.11` as the content.

### Fixed
- Fix adding documentation to a constructor-only argument (`dataclasses.InitVar`) by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8357 \
  Note that `InitVar` should be the outer most type in order to be processed correctly by `dataclasses.dataclass()`:
  ```python
  >>> url: dataclasses.InitVar[Annotated[str, Doc("Some URL")]]
  ```
- Fix `dagger.Ignore` when used in object attributes (dataclass field) by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8359

🐍 https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/v0.12.5/
📖 https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-python-v0.12.5/


### Deprecated
- `Arg` has been renamed to `Name` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8109 \
  For code that currently uses `Arg` to avoid a naming conflict with a reserved
  keyword, it can be removed since the SDK will strip the last `_` in an
  argument's name when interfacing with the API. For other needs, just rename
  `Arg` to `Name`.
