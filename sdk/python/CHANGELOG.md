This SDK uses 🚙 Engine + 🚗 CLI version `v0.18.15`. [See what changed in that release](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/releases/tag/v0.18.15).

🐍 https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/v0.18.15/
📖 https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-python-v0.18.15/

### 🔥 Breaking Changes
- Improved error handling and reporting in Python modules with clearer error messages and better debugging support by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10532 \
  The root logger is now setup with a handler that will ultimately show as stderr output in visualization (TUI/Cloud) for the "warning" log level and above.
  
  There’s a possible breaking change if a non async function returns a coroutine. Marked as breaking out of caution as it should have low impact. This would work previously but it’s now validated to avoid confusion as it’s expected to be a mistake and not intentional. An `async` needs to be added to the function’s signature, and an `await` on the call that returns the coroutine (value returned by an async function).

### Changed
- Default Python version in Dagger modules changed to 3.13 and build backend to uv_build by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10825 \
  The new Python version will only be used in new modules or older modules without
  a pinned Python version.
  
  To upgrade an existing module, update the minimum required Python version in
  `pyproject.toml`:
  ```toml
  requires-python = ">=3.13"
  ```
  Or make sure it's set to `">=3.12"` to remain on Python 3.12. 
  
  See the [Runtime container](https://docs.dagger.io/api/module-structure#runtime-container) 
  documentation for more information.

### Fixed
- codegen: fixed invalid function argument default values that contain single quotes by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10778
- Fix wrong enum value aliases in client bindings by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10802
- Update constraints for gql to prevent fetching incompatible version by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10888

🐍 https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/v0.15.0/
📖 https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-python-v0.15.0/

### 🔥 Breaking Changes
- `str(ExecErr)` no longer contains the values of `stdout` or `stderr` by @vito in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9033 \
  When comparing error values for expected output, use the more specific values.
- Removed the deprecated `index-url` and `index-extral-url` settings under `[tool.uv]` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9127 \
  These settings were deprecated in Dagger [v0.14.0](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/releases?q=tag%3Asdk%2Fpython%2Fv0) since uv [v0.4.23](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases/tag/0.4.23) replaced them with the `[[tool.uv.index]]` table. See [Package indexes](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/configuration/indexes/) for the full documentation.

### Fixed
- Fixed dagger init generating the wrong package name when using a module name that includes a number by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/9000

## sdk/python/v0.14.0 - 2024-11-08

🐍 https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/v0.14.0/
📖 https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-python-v0.14.0/


### Changed
- New modules will get a package name based on the module name instead of being hardcoded to "main" by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8709 \
  Existing modules should work the same because "main" is used as a fallback. There's also a new setting (using a Python entry point) to precisely tell Dagger where the main object should be imported from.
  
  For example:
  ```toml
  # pyproject.toml
  
  [project.entry-points."dagger.mod"]
  main_object = "my_module.main:MyModule"
  ```

### Deprecated
- In modules, the `index-url` and `index-extra-url` settings in `[tool.uv]` are now deprecated in favor of the new `[[tool.uv.index]]` setting by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8772

🐍 https://pypi.org/project/dagger-io/v0.13.0/
📖 https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/sdk-python-v0.13.0/


### Changed
- Use `uv.lock` by default in new Dagger Modules by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8311 \
  Simpler workflow with uv:

  ```
  dagger init --sdk=python my-module
  cd my-module
  uv run vim .
  ```
  
  To replace `uv.lock` with `requirements.lock`:

  ```
  uv export --no-dev --no-emit-workspace --no-emit-package=dagger-io -o requirements.lock
  uv remove dagger-io
  rm uv.lock
  ```
  
  To migrate an existing module to `uv.lock`:

  ```
  dagger develop
  uv add --editable ./sdk
  uv run vim .
  ```
  
  If both files exist, `uv.lock` will take precedence.
- Modules run in Python 3.12 by default by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8311 \
  To pin to Python 3.11 in a module, either change `requires-python = ">=3.11"` in `pyproject.toml` or create a `.python-version` file with `3.11` as the content.

### Fixed
- Fix adding documentation to a constructor-only argument (`dataclasses.InitVar`) by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8357 \
  Note that `InitVar` should be the outer most type in order to be processed correctly by `dataclasses.dataclass()`:
  ```python
  >>> url: dataclasses.InitVar[Annotated[str, Doc("Some URL")]]
  ```
- Fix `dagger.Ignore` when used in object attributes (dataclass field) by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8359

### Deprecated
- `Arg` has been renamed to `Name` by @helderco in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/8109 \
  For code that currently uses `Arg` to avoid a naming conflict with a reserved
  keyword, it can be removed since the SDK will strip the last `_` in an
  argument's name when interfacing with the API. For other needs, just rename
  `Arg` to `Name`.
