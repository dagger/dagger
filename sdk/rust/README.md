# Dagger Rust SDK

## Plan for next release

- [x] Introduce [thiserror](https://docs.rs/thiserror/latest/thiserror/) for
      better errors
- [x] Add compatibility with `dagger run`
- [ ] Add open telemetry tracing to the sdk
- [ ] Remove `id().await?` from passing to other dagger graphs, this should make
      the design much cleaner
- [x] Update to newest upstream release
- [ ] Fix bugs
  - [x] Run in conjunction with golang and other sdks
  - [ ] Stabilize the initial `Arc<Query>` model into something more extensible

## Examples

See [examples](https://github.com/dagger/dagger/tree/d5a67f25e63832b7b2dcd9986f96bac91b1a5930/sdk/rust/examples).

Run them like so:

```bash
cargo run --example first-pipeline
```

The examples match the folder name in each directory in examples.

## Install

Simply install like:

```bash
cargo add dagger-sdk
```

### Usage

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> eyre::Result<()> {
    dagger_sdk::connect(|client| async move {
        let version = client
            .container()
            .from("golang:1.19")
            .with_exec(vec!["go", "version"])
            .stdout()
            .await?;

        println!("Hello from Dagger and {}", version.trim());
        Ok(())
    })
    .await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

And run it like a normal application:

```bash
cargo run
```
