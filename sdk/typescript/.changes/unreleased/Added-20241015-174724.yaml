  Allow external custom runtime as base image using `dagger.baseImage` field in the module's `package.json`.

  *Warning*: Only alpine images are supported by the runtime.
  *Note*: You shoud also set `dagger.runtime` field to `node` or `bun` to force a specific runtime, otherwise
  the runtime will be detected based on files present in the module.

  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "dagger": {
      "baseImage": "node:23.2.0-alpine@sha256:ecefaffd4706c5879af52e022fdb8ea30cbd6590e2a30d05347790d690727c6c",
      "runtime": "node"
    }
  }
  ```
