  Add missing @opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger dependency to fix build failures.
  
  The @opentelemetry/sdk-node package dynamically imports the Jaeger exporter
  but it was not included in dependencies, causing "Module not found" errors
  in webpack and other bundlers when building projects that use @dagger.io/dagger.
