### Added
- Detect field `packageManager` in `package.json` to use it during the runtime. by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/7864 \
  If the field is not present, the runtime will try to detect it from the lock
  file. By default, the runtime will use yarn@v1.22.0.

  Additionally, this also adds improvements to the SDK runtime to generate a
  lockfile based on the package manager, changes the setup by moving
  dependencies installation to the `ModuleRuntime` function, which should
  improve performances during init & updates. Finally, cache mount folders are
  added for npm, yarn, pnpm & bun.
