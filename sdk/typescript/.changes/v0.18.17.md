### Fixed
- Add missing @opentelemetry/exporter-jaeger dependency to fix build failures by @joedanz in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10887 \
  The @opentelemetry/sdk-node package dynamically imports the Jaeger exporter
  but it was not included in dependencies, causing "Module not found" errors
  in webpack and other bundlers when building projects that use @dagger.io/dagger.

### Dependencies
- Bump Engine to v0.18.17 by @jedevc in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10986
