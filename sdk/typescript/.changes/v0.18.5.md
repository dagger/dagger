## sdk/typescript/v0.18.5 - 2025-04-25

### Added
- Bundle the Typescript SDK library instead of coping the whole module by @TomChv in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10094 \
  This improves:
  - Maintainability: less files are generated.
  - Dependency management: The SDK already bundles all dependencies, so only user's specific one used in the module will be downloaded.
  - Performances: see benchmark: https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10094#issuecomment-2786296756
  
  Transition to the bundle SDK is done automatically on the next `dagger develop` so it's not a breaking change.
  
  How to migrate to the bundle SDK:
  - Remove `@dagger.io/dagger=./sdk` from your package.json dependencies.
  - Remove the `sdk` directory from your module.
  - Run `dagger develop`
  You need to manually remove the sdk directory because the runtime cannot remove files from your host, even if
  they are not used by the runtime.
- Enable strict and skipLibCheck settings in tsconfigs by @jahands in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10203

### Dependencies
- Bump Engine to v0.18.5 by @sipsma in https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10274
