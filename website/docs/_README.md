# FAQ

The intent behind this README is to answer contributor questions regarding [docs.dagger.io](https://docs.dagger.io).

## What happens to a new doc page after the PR gets merged?

It gets automatically deployed to [docs.dagger.io](https://docs.dagger.io).

The doc URL will use the `slug` property from the doc markdown metadata.

Given `slug: /1001/install/`, the live URL will be [docs.dagger.io/1001/install](https://docs.dagger.io/1001/install)

## How can I run docs locally?

You will need to have `yarn` and Node.js v16 installed.

From the root of the repo run the following command: `make web`

This will install all dependencies, start the docs web server locally and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

## How can I add a new doc page?

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ new.sh            1. $ ./new.sh my-doc-title
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile (repo root)  2. $ make web
â””â”€â”€ website/              3. $ npx docusaurus build
```

1. From the `docs` dir, run `./new.sh my-doc-title`
   This will create a new Markdown file for the new doc page with a random ID, e.g `docs/f1a2c-my-doc-title.md`

2. After executing the `./new.sh` command, make sure to previsualize the new doc by running the `make web` command from the root directory. This will trigger `docusaurus start`, [creating a local dev server](https://docusaurus.io/docs/cli#docusaurus-start-sitedir).  
   `make web` **is required** when creating a new doc because it exports a new `_redirects` file, located in `/website/static/_redirects`. This is a configuration file that maps the docs ID with their respective filename, so every doc can also be reached with only the UUID in the URL.  
   Try it out and you'll see how `https://docs.dagger.io/1247` redirects to `https://docs.dagger.io/1247/dagger-fs`  
   Don't worry if the redirection doesn't work in your new doc, as it's a server-side implementation that will only take effect in production. Just make sure it has the same format as the rest of the mappings in the `_redirects` file.

3. Once created and previsualized, run `npx docusaurus build` from the `/website` directory. This command verifies no links are broken when parsing markdown, among other things, so it's a good way to "test" your new doc.

This new doc will not be added to the navigation.
We prefer to keep the organisation of doc pages, and writing them separate.
For the time being - 2022 Q1 - the focus is on writing self-contained doc content.
Don't worry about where to fit this content, it's enough to keep this in mind: [Writing effective documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6zeikbTgVc&t=19s).

### Adding or editing a Quickstart page

> **Note**
> "Step", "`.mdx` file" and "doc" are used interchangeably.
> **Note**
>The new format of the step only affects the steps that have an embedded Playground instance. If no embed is present in the step (no `<QuickstartDoc>` component is present in the `.mdx` file), the default Docusarus theme is used.  

The new layout is based on two columns for wide screens. The embed is placed as `sticky` on the right. This allows the user to scroll through the doc content and keep the editor visible.  
To add or edit a step, be sure to:  

- Create an object with the SDK name as properties and their Playground ID as their value, then pass it to the `<QuickstartDoc>` component as an "embeds" prop.

```jsx
export const ids = {
    Go: "ho4ZF-6naKv",
    Node: "aPB-msb5UEn",
    Python: "tqaPp2aVr_L"
}

<QuickstartDoc embeds={ids}>
```

- Encapsulate the whole quickstart content inside the `<QuickstartDoc>` component. This will pass all the content as children. This component will take care of rendering each column accordingly.
- Use the `<Embed>` component instead of the native `<iframe>` element. This component makes sure to add a spinner while the `<iframe>` is loading, besides taking care of some custom styling.  
- Make sure the `<TabItem>` `value` prop has the same values as the `ids` object property names. Use `value=Node` instead of value="Node.js" on the prop, as property names cannot contain dots in JS.

See [children](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/Children) and [tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs) for implementation context.

## Debugging

A [debug plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-debug) is available at `http://localhost:3000/__docusaurus/debug`.  
This is a great resource to help you solve common problems that show up in your terminal when starting a local dev server.
