# FAQ

The intent behind this README is to answer contributor questions regarding [docs.dagger.io](https://docs.dagger.io).

## What happens to a new doc page after the PR gets merged?

It gets automatically deployed to [docs.dagger.io](https://docs.dagger.io).

The doc URL will use the `slug` property from the doc markdown metadata.

Given `slug: /1001/install/`, the live URL will be [docs.dagger.io/1001/install](https://docs.dagger.io/1001/install)

## How can I run docs locally?

You will need to have `yarn` and Node.js v16 installed.

From the top-level dir - `cd ../` - run the following command: `make web`

This will install all dependencies, start the docs web server locally and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

## How can I add a new doc page?

From the `docs` dir, run `./new.sh doc-title`

This will create a new Markdown file for the new doc page, i.e. `docs/1214-doc-title.md`

This new doc will not be added to the navigation.
We prefer to keep the organisation of doc pages, and writing them separate.
For the time being - 2022 Q1 - the focus is on writing self-contained doc content.
Don't worry about where to fit this content, it's enough to keep this in mind: [Writing effective documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6zeikbTgVc&t=19s).

## What else should I keep in mind as I add new doc pages?

- "I would propose starting off with common use case and get a feedback loop possible where customers get to somewhat steer the topics they want next. Maybe via  a vote system to prioritise .
