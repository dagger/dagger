# Project Zenith

## Overview

*Project Zenith* is the codename of a future release of Dagger, currently in development.

The goal of Project Zenith is to make Dagger more accessible, by delivering it as a CLI tool rather than just a library.

Features of Project Zenith include:

* Major expansion of the `dagger` CLI, removing the need to create a custom CLI for each project
* Major expansion of the Dagger API, with a complete cross-language extension and composition system
* An open ecosystem of reusable content, to take advantage of the extension and composition system
* A major overhaul to our documentation and marketing, to explain Dagger as a tool for development and CI, rather than "just a CI engine"

## Status

As of August 24 2023, Project Zenith is in active development, with the goal of releasing before the end the year.
