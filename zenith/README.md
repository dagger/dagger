# Project Zenith

## Overview

*Project Zenith* is the codename of a future release of Dagger, currently in development.

The goal of Project Zenith is to make Dagger more accessible, by delivering it as a CLI tool rather than just a library.

Features of Project Zenith include:

* Major expansion of the `dagger` CLI, removing the need to create a custom CLI for each project
* Major expansion of the Dagger API, with a complete cross-language extension and composition system
* An open ecosystem of reusable content, to take advantage of the extension and composition system
* A major overhaul to our documentation and marketing, to explain Dagger as a tool for development and CI, rather than "just a CI engine"

## Status

As of August 24 2023, Project Zenith is in active development, with the goal of releasing before the end the year.

## How to participate

The Dagger Engine is developed in the open, and Project Zenith is no exception.

* Discussions take place [on our Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/707636530424053791/1120503349599543376)
* Contributors and testers meet every friday at 09:00 Pacific time [on our Discord audio room](https://discord.com/channels/707636530424053791/911305510882513037)


## How to test it

To get started, clone or pull this branch:

```sh
# fresh clone
git clone https://github.com/shykes/dagger --branch zenith-functions ./dagger/

# OR pull branch
git remote add shykes https://github.com/shykes/dagger
git fetch shykes zenith-functions
git checkout zenith-functions
```

Next, build the dev `dagger` CLI and start the dev engine:

```sh
# cd into repo
cd ./dagger/

# build dev CLI and engine
./hack/dev
```

Finally, `cd` one last time into the directory containing this README.md file.
It contains an [`.envrc`][direnv] file that will automatically point your
`dagger` CLI to the dev engine.

Follow the [install instructions][direnv] for `direnv` if you don't have it
already, and then run:

[direnv]: https://direnv.net/

```sh
# cd into zenith subdir
cd ./zenith/

# enable .envrc (be sure to start a new shell)
direnv allow
```

At this point you should have a fully functioning `dagger` CLI and dev engine.

You can test it by running the included demo module:

```sh
cd vito-mod/
echo '{vito{helloWorld}}' | dagger query --progress=plain
```

## Creating your first Module

Create a new directory under `./zenith/` and run `dagger mod init` to
bootstrap your first module. We'll call it `potato` here, but you can choose
your favorite food.

```sh
cd ./zenith/ # if not there already

mkdir potato-mod/
cd potato-mod/

# initialize Dagger module
#
# NOTE: currently Go is the only supported SDK.
dagger mod init --name=potato --sdk=go
```

This will generate `dagger.gen.go`, `dagger.json`, and an initial `main.go`
file.

If you like, you can run the generated `main.go` like so:

```sh
echo '{potato{myFunction(stringArg:"hey"){id}}}' | dagger query
```

Let's try changing the `main.go`. We named our module `potato`, so that means all
methods on the `Potato` type are published as functions. Let's replace the
template with something simpler:

```go
package main

import "context"

type Potato struct{}

func (m *Potato) HelloWorld(context.Context) (string, error) {
	return "hey", nil
}
```

> Currently all methods _must_ accept a `ctx` argument and include an `error`
> return value. These constraints will be lifted soon.

Next, run `dagger mod sync`. **You will need to run this command after every
change to your module code.** We will figure out how to automate it in the
future.

To run the new function, once again use `dagger query`:

```sh
echo '{potato{helloWorld}}' | dagger query
```

That's it! ...For now.

## More things you can do

### Chaining

Your functions can return objects, which in turn can define new functions. This allows for "chaining" of functions in the same style as the core Dagger API.

As long as your object can be JSON-serialized by your SDK, its state will be preserved and passed to the next function in the chain.

Here is an example module using the Go SDK:

```golang
// A Dagger module for saying hello to the world
type HelloWorld struct {
  Greeting string
  Name string
}

func (hello *HelloWorld) WithGreeting(ctx context.Context, greeting string) (*HelloWorld, error) {
  hello.Greeting = greeting
  return hello, nil
}

func (hello *HelloWorld) WithName(ctx context.Context, name string) (*HelloWorld, error) {
  hello.Name = name
  return hello, nil
}

func (hello *HelloWorld) Message(ctx context.Context) (string, error) {
  var (
    greeting = hello.Greeting
    name = hello.Name
  )
  if greeting == "" {
    greeting = "Hello"
  }
  if name == "" {
    name = "World"
  }
  return fmt.Sprintf("%s, %s!", greeting, name), nil
}
```

And here is an example query for this module:

```graphql
{
  helloWorld {
    message
    withName(name: "Monde") {
      withGreeting(greeting: "Bonjour") {
        message
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The result will be:

```json
{
  "helloWorld": {
    "message": "Hello, World!",
    "withName": {
      "withGreeting": {
        "message": "Bonjour, Monde!"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Extend core types

You can add a new function to accept and return a `*Container`.

```go
package main

import "context"

type Potato struct{}

func (m *Potato) HelloWorld(context.Context) (string, error) {
  return "hey", nil
}

func (m *Potato) Snyk(ctx context.Context, ctr *Container) (*Container, error) {
  return ctr, nil
}

func (ctr *Container) Snyk(ctx context.Context, token string, path string) (*Container, error) {
  c := ctr.
    WithWorkdir("/tmp").
    WithExec([]string{"curl", "https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-alpine", "-o", "snyk"}).
    WithExec([]string{"chmod", "+x", "snyk"}).
    WithExec([]string{"mv", "./snyk", "/usr/local/bin"}).
    WithWorkdir(path).
    WithEnvVariable("SNYK_TOKEN", token).
    WithExec([]string{"snyk", "test"})

  return c, nil
}
```

> **CAVEAT:** there is currently a bug where functions added to a core type. In
> order for these functions to be discovered, the core type must be referenced
> by a function signature added to the module's type. The example above only
> works because of the `Potato.Snyk` method.

Next, run `dagger mod sync`.

To run the new function, once again use `dagger query` (this example requires a Snyk token):

```sh
dagger query  << EOF
query test {
  container {
    from(address: "alpine") {
      withExec(args: ["apk", "add", "curl"]) {
        withExec(args: ["apk", "add", "git"]) {
          withExec(args: ["git", "clone", "https://github.com/snyk/snyk-demo-todo.git", "/src"]) {
              snyk(token: "TOKEN", path: "/src") {
                stdout
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
EOF
```

If you push your module to a Git repository, you can reference it by it's github URL.

```sh
dagger query -m "github.com/user/repo@main" << EOF
query test {
   ...
}
EOF
```

or, if your module is in a subdirectory of the Git repo:

```sh
dagger query -m "github.com/user/repo/subdirectory@main" << EOF
query test {
   ...
}
EOF
```

* Return custom types with methods defined on them
